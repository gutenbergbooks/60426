    ILLYRIANS, MACEDONIANS, PÆONIANS.</h2>
</div>

<p class="mt1"><span class="smcap">Northward</span> of the tribes
called Epirotic lay those more numerous and widely extended tribes
who bore the general name of Illyrians; bounded on the west by the
Adriatic, on the east by the mountain-range of Skardus, the northern
continuation of Pindus,—and thus covering what is now called Middle
and Upper Albania, together with the more northerly mountains of
Montenegro, Herzegovina, and Bosnia. Their limits to the north and
north-east cannot be assigned, but the Dardani and Autariatæ must
have reached to the north-east of Skardus and even east of the
Servian plain of Kossovo; while along the Adriatic coast, Skylax
extends the race so far northward as to include Dalmatia, treating
the Liburnians and Istrians beyond them as not Illyrian: yet Appian
and others consider the Liburnians and Istrians as Illyrian, and
Herodotus even includes under that name the Eneti, or Veneti, at the
extremity of the Adriatic gulf.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1"
class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The Bulini, accord<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_2">[p. 2]</span>ing to Skylax, were the northernmost
Illyrian tribe: the Amantini, immediately northward of the Epirotic
Chaonians, were the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[p. 3]</span>
southernmost. Among the southern Illyrian tribes are to be numbered
the Taulantii,—originally the possessors, afterwards the immediate
neighbors, of the territory on which Epidamnus was founded. The
ancient geographer Hekatæus<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a> (about 500<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_4">[p. 4]</span> <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), is
sufficiently well acquainted with them to specify their town
Sesarêthus: he also named the Chelidonii as their northern, the
Encheleis as their southern neighbors; and the Abri also as a tribe
nearly adjoining. We hear of the Illyrian Parthini, nearly in the
same regions,—of the Dassaretii,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3"
class="fnanchor">[3]</a> near Lake Lychnidus,—of the Penestæ, with
a fortified town Uscana, north of the Dassaretii,—of the Ardiæans,
the Autariatæ, and the Dardanians, throughout Upper Albania eastward
as far as Upper Mœsia, including the range of Skardus itself; so
that there were some Illyrian tribes conterminous on the east with
Macedonians, and on the south with Macedonians as well as with
Pæonians. Strabo even extends some of the Illyrian tribes much
farther northward, nearly to the Julian Alps.<a id="FNanchor_4"
href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>With the exception of some portions of what is now called Middle
Albania, the territory of these tribes consisted principally of
mountain pastures with a certain proportion of fertile valley, but
rarely expanding into a plain. The Autariatæ had the reputation
of being unwarlike, but the Illyrians generally were poor,
rapacious, fierce, and formidable in battle. They shared with the
remote Thracian tribes the custom of tattooing<a id="FNanchor_5"
href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> their bodies and of
offering human sacrifices: moreover, they were always ready to
sell their military service for hire, like the modern Al<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[p. 5]</span>banian Schkipetars, in
whom probably their blood yet flows, though with considerable
admixture from subsequent emigrations. Of the Illyrian kingdom
on the Adriatic coast, with Skodra (Scutari) for its capital
city, which became formidable by its reckless piracies in the
third century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, we hear nothing
in the flourishing period of Grecian history. The description of
Skylax notices in his day, all along the northern Adriatic, a
considerable and standing traffic between the coast and the interior,
carried on by Liburnians, Istrians, and the small Grecian insular
settlements of Pharus and Issa. But he does not name Skodra, and
probably this strong post—together with the Greek town Lissus,
founded by Dionysius of Syracuse—was occupied after his time by
conquerors from the interior,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6"
class="fnanchor">[6]</a> the predecessors of Agrôn and Gentius,—just
as the coast-land of the Thermaic gulf was conquered by inland
Macedonians.</p>

<p>Once during the Peloponnesian war, a detachment of hired
Illyrians, marching into Macedonia Lynkêstis (seemingly over the pass
of Skardus a little east of Lychnidus, or Ochrida), tried the valor
of the Spartan Brasidas; and on that occasion—as in the expedition
above alluded to of the Epirots against Akarnania—we shall notice
the marked superiority of the Grecian character, even in the case of
an armament chiefly composed of helots newly enfranchised, over both
Macedonians and Illyrians,—we shall see the contrast between brave
men acting in concert and obedience to a common authority, and an
assailing host of warriors, not less brave individually, but in which
every man is his own master,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7"
class="fnanchor">[7]</a> and fights as he pleases. The rapid and
impetuous rush of the Illyrians, if the first shock failed of its
effect, was succeeded by an equally rapid retreat or flight. We hear
nothing afterwards respecting these barbarians until the time of
Philip of Macedon, whose vigor and military energy first repressed
their incursions, and afterwards partially conquered them. It seems
to have been about this period (400-350 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>)
that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[p. 6]</span> great
movement of the Gauls from west to east took place, which brought
the Gallic Skordiski and other tribes into the regions between the
Danube and the Adriatic sea, and which probably dislodged some of the
northern Illyrians so as to drive them upon new enterprises and fresh
abodes.</p>

<p>What is now called Middle Albania, the Illyrian territory
immediately north of Epirus, is much superior to the latter
in productiveness.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8"
class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Though mountainous, it possesses more
both of low hill and valley, and ampler as well as more fertile
cultivable spaces. Epidamnus and Apollonia formed the seaports
of this territory, and the commerce with the southern Illyrians,
less barbarous than the northern, was one of the sources<a
id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
of their great prosperity during the first century of their
existence,—a prosperity interrupted in the case of the Epidamnians
by internal dissensions, which impaired their ascendency over
their Illyrian neighbors, and ultimately placed them at variance
with their mother-city Korkyra. The commerce between these Greek
seaports and the interior tribes, when once the former became
strong enough to render violent attack from the latter hopeless,
was reciprocally beneficial to both of them. Grecian oil and wine
were introduced among these barbarians, whose chiefs at the same
time learned to appreciate the woven fabrics,<a id="FNanchor_10"
href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> the polished and
carved metallic work, the tempered weapons, and the pottery, which
issued from Grecian artisans. Moreover, the importation sometimes
of salt-fish, and always that of salt itself, was of the greatest
importance to these inland residents, especially for such localities
as possessed lakes abounding in fish, like that of Lychnidus. We
hear of wars between the Autariatæ and the Ardiæi, respecting
salt-springs near their boundaries, and also of other tribes whom
the privation of salt reduced to the necessity of submitting
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[p. 7]</span> the Romans.<a
id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> On
the other hand, these tribes possessed two articles of exchange so
precious in the eyes of the Greeks, that Polybius reckons them as
absolutely indispensable,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12"
class="fnanchor">[12]</a>—cattle and slaves;<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_8">[p. 8]</span> which latter were doubtless procured
from Illyria, often in exchange for salt, as they were from Thrace
and from the Euxine and from Aquileia in the Adriatic, through the
internal wars of one tribe with another. Silver-mines were worked at
Damastium in Illyria. Wax and honey were probably also articles of
export, and it is a proof that the natural products of Illyria were
carefully sought out, when we find a species of iris peculiar to the
country collected and sent to Corinth, where its root was employed to
give the special flavor to a celebrated kind of aromatic unguent.<a
id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>Nor was the intercourse between the Hellenic ports and Illyrians
inland exclusively commercial. Grecian exiles also found their way
into Illyria, and Grecian mythes became localized there, as may
be seen by the tale of Kadmus and Harmonia, from whom the chiefs
of the Illyrian Encheleis professed to trace their descent.<a
id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>The Macedonians of the fourth century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>
acquired, from the ability and enterprise of two successive kings,
a great perfection in Greek military organization without any of
the loftier Hellenic qualities. Their career in Greece is purely
destructive, extinguishing the free movement of the separate cities,
and dis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[p. 9]</span>arming the
citizen-soldier to make room for the foreign mercenary, whose
sword was unhallowed by any feelings of patriotism,—yet totally
incompetent to substitute any good system of central or pacific
administration. But the Macedonians of the seventh and sixth
centuries <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> are an aggregate only of rude
inland tribes, subdivided into distinct petty principalities, and
separated from the Greeks by a wider ethnical difference even
than the Epirots; since Herodotus, who considers the Epirotic
Molossians and Thesprotians as children of Hellen, decidedly
thinks the contrary respecting the Macedonians.<a id="FNanchor_15"
href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> In the main, however,
they seem at this early period analogous to the Epirots in character
and civilization. They had some few towns, but were chiefly village
residents, extremely brave and pugnacious. The customs of some of
their tribes enjoined that the man who had not yet slain an enemy
should be distinguished on some occasions by a badge of discredit.<a
id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The original seats of the Macedonians were in the regions east of
the chain of Skardus (the northerly continuation of Pindus)—north of
the chain called the Cambunian mountains, which connects Olympus with
Pindus, and which forms the north-western boundary of Thessaly. But
they did not reach so far eastward as the Thermaic gulf; apparently
not farther eastward than Mount Bermius, or about the longitude of
Edessa and Berrhoia. They thus covered the upper portions of the
course of the rivers Haliakmôn and Erigôn, before the junction of
the latter with the Axius; while the upper course of the Axius,
higher than this point of junction, appears to have belonged to
Pæonia,—though the boundaries of Macedonia and Pæonia cannot be
distinctly marked out at any time.</p>

<p>The large space of country included between the above-mentioned
boundaries is in great part mountainous, occupied by lateral ridges,
or elevations, which connect themselves with the main line of
Skardus. But it also comprises three wide alluvial basins, or plains,
which are of great extent and well-adapted to<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_10">[p. 10]</span> cultivation,—the plain of Tettovo, or
Kalkandele (northernmost of the three), which contains the sources
and early course of the Axius, or Vardar,—that of Bitolia, coinciding
to a great degree with the ancient Pelagonia, wherein the Erigon
flows towards the Axius,—and the larger and more undulating basin
of Greveno and Anaselitzas, containing the upper Haliakmôn with its
confluent streams. This latter region is separated from the basin of
Thessaly by a mountainous line of considerable length, but presenting
numerous easy passes.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17"
class="fnanchor">[17]</a> Reckoning the basin of Thessaly as a
fourth, here are four distinct inclosed plains on the east side of
this long range of Skardus and Pindus,—each generally bounded by
mountains which rise precipitously to an alpine height, and each
leaving only one cleft for drainage by a single river,—the Axius,
the Erigôn, the Haliakmôn, and the Peneius respectively. All four,
moreover, though of high level above the sea, are yet for the most
part of distinguished fertility, especially the plains of Tettovo,
of Bitolia, and Thessaly. The fat, rich land to the east of Pindus
and Skardus is described as forming a marked contrast with the light
calcareous soil of the Albanian plains and valleys on the western
side. The basins of Bitolia and of the Haliakmôn, with the mountains
around and adjoining, were possessed by the original Macedonians;
that of Tettovo, on the north, by a portion of the Pæonians. Among
the four, Thessaly is the most spacious; yet the two comprised in the
primitive seats of the Macedonians, both of them very considerable
in magnitude, formed a territory better calculated to nourish and
to generate a considerable population, than the less favored home,
and smaller breadth of valley and plain, occupied by Epirots or
Illyrians. Abundance of corn easily raised, of pasture for cattle,
and of new fertile land open to cultivation, would suffice to
increase the numbers of hardy villagers, indifferent to luxury as
well as to accumulation, and exempt from that oppressive extortion of
rulers which now harasses the same fine regions.<a id="FNanchor_18"
href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[p. 11]</span>The inhabitants
of this primitive Macedonia doubtless differed much in ancient
times, as they do now, according as they dwelt on mountain or plain,
and in soil and climate more or less kind; but all acknowledged a
common ethnical name and nationality, and the tribes were in many
cases distinguished from each other, not by having substantive names
of their own, but merely by local epithets of Grecian origin. Thus
we find Elymiotæ Macedonians, or Macedonians of Elymeia,—Lynkestæ
Macedonians, or Macedonians of Lynkus, etc. Orestæ is doubtless an
adjunct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[p. 12]</span> name of
the same character. The inhabitants of the more northerly tracts,
called Pelagonia and Deuriopis, were also portions of the Macedonian
aggregate, though neighbors of the Pæonians, to whom they bore
much affinity: whether the Eordi and Almopians were of Macedonian
race, it is more difficult to say. The Macedonian language was
different from Illyrian,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19"
class="fnanchor">[19]</a> from Thracian, and seemingly also from
Pæonian. It was also different from Greek, yet apparently not more
widely distinct than that of the Epirots,—so that the acquisition
of Greek was comparatively easy to the chiefs and people, though
there were always some Greek letters which they were incapable of
pronouncing. And when we follow their history, we shall find in
them more of the regular warrior, conquering in order to maintain
dominion and tribute, and less of the armed plunderer,—than in the
Illyrians, Thracians, or Epirots, by whom it was their misfortune
to be surrounded. They approach nearer to the Thessalians,<a
id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and to
the other ungifted members of the Hellenic family.</p>

<p>The large and comparatively productive region covered by the
various sections of Macedonians, helps to explain that increase of
ascendency which they successively acquired over all their neighbors.
It was not, however, until a late period that they became united
under one government. At first each section, how many we do not
know, had its own prince, or chief. The Elymiots, or inhabitants of
Elymeia, the southernmost portion of Macedonia, were thus originally
distinct and independent; also the Orestæ, in mountain-seats somewhat
north-west of the Ely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[p.
13]</span>miots,—the Lynkêstæ and Eordi, who occupied portions of
territory on the track of the subsequent Egnatian way, between
Lychnidus (Ochrida) and Edessa,—the Pelagonians,<a id="FNanchor_21"
href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> with a town of the
same name, in the fertile plain of Bitolia,—and the more northerly
Deuriopians. And the early political union was usually so loose,
that each of these denominations probably includes many petty
independencies, small towns, and villages. That section of the
Macedonian name who afterwards swallowed up all the rest and became
known as <i>The Macedonians</i>, had their original centre at Ægæ, or
Edessa,—the lofty, commanding, and picturesque site of the modern
Vodhena. And though the residence of the kings was in later times
transferred to the marshy Pella, in the maritime plain beneath,
yet Edessa was always retained as the regal burial-place, and as
the hearth to which the religious continuity of the nation, so
much reverenced in ancient times, was attached. This ancient town,
which lay on the Roman Egnatian way from Lychnidus to Pella and
Thessalonika, formed the pass over the mountain-ridge called Bermius,
or that prolongation to the northward of Mount Olympus, through which
the Haliakmôn makes its way out into the maritime plain at Verria, by
a cleft more precipitous and impracticable than that of the Peneius
in the defile of Tempê.</p>

<p>This mountain-chain called Bermius, extending from Olympus
considerably to the north of Edessa, formed the original eastern
boundary of the Macedonian tribes; who seem at first not to have
reached the valley of the Axius in any part of its course, and who
certainly did not reach at first to the Thermaic gulf. Between the
last-mentioned gulf and the eastern counterforts of Olympus and
Bermius there exists a narrow strip of plain land or low hill,
which reaches from the mouth of the Peneius to the head of the
Thermaic gulf. It there widens into the spacious and fertile plain
of Salonichi, comprising the mouths of the Haliakmôn, the Axius,
and the Echeidôrus: the river Ludias, which flows from Edessa
into the marshes surrounding Pella, and which in antiquity joined
the Haliakmôn near its mouth, has now altered its course so as to
join the Axius. This narrow strip, between<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_14">[p. 14]</span> the mouths of the Peneius and the
Haliakmôn, was the original abode of the Pierian Thracians, who dwelt
close to the foot of Olympus, and among whom the worship of the
Muses seems to have been a primitive characteristic; Grecian poetry
teems with local allusions and epithets which appear traceable to
this early fact, though we are unable to follow it in detail. North
of the Pierians, from the mouth of the Haliakmôn to that of the
Axius, dwelt the Bottiæans.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22"
class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Beyond the river Axius, at the lower<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[p. 15]</span> part of its course, began
the tribes of the great Thracian race,—Mygdonians, Krestônians,
Edônians, Bisaltæ, Sithonians: the Mygdonians seem to have been
originally the most powerful, since the country still continued to be
called by their name, Mygdonia, even after the Macedonian conquest.
These, and various other Thracian tribes, originally occupied most
part of the country between the mouth of the Axius and that of the
Strymon; together with that memorable three-pronged peninsula which
derived from the Grecian colonies its name of Chalkidikê. It will
thus appear, if we consider the Bottiæans as well as the Pierians to
be Thracians, that the Thracian race extended originally southward
as far as the mouth of the Peneius: the Bottiæans professed, indeed,
a Kretan origin, but this pretension is not noticed by either
Herodotus or Thucydidês. In the time of Skylax,<a id="FNanchor_23"
href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> seemingly during the
early reign of Philip the son of Amyntas, Macedonia and Thrace were
separated by the Strymon.</p>

<p>We have yet to notice the Pæonians, a numerous and much-divided
race,—seemingly neither Thracian nor Macedonian nor Illyrian, but
professing to be descended from the Teukri of Troy,—who occupied
both banks of the Strymon, from the neighborhood of Mount Skomius,
in which that river rises, down to the lake near its mouth. Some of
their tribes possessed the fertile plain of Siris (now Seres),—the
land immediately north of Mount Pangæus,—and even a portion of
the space through which Xerxês marched on his route from Akanthus
to Therma. Besides this, it appears that the upper parts of the
valley of the Axius were also occupied by Pæonian tribes; how far
down the river they extended, we are unable to say. We are not to
suppose that the whole territory between Axius and Strymon was
continuously peopled by them. Continuous population is not the
character of the ancient world, and it seems, moreover, that while
the land immediately bordering on both rivers is in very<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[p. 16]</span> many places of the
richest quality, the spaces between the two are either mountain
or barren low hill,—forming a marked contrast with the rich
alluvial basin of the Macedonian river Erigon.<a id="FNanchor_24"
href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> The Pæonians, in
their north-western tribes, thus bordered upon the Macedonian
Pelagonia,—in their northern tribes, upon the Illyrian Dardani and
Autariatæ,—in their eastern, southern, and south-eastern tribes, upon
the Thracians and Pierians;<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25"
class="fnanchor">[25]</a> that is, upon the second seats occupied by
the expelled Pierians under Mount Pangæus.</p>

<p>Such was, as far as we can make it out, the position of the
Macedonians and their immediate neighbors, in the seventh century
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> It was first altered by the
enterprise and ability of a family of exiled Greeks, who conducted
a section of the Macedonian people to those conquests which
their descendants, Philip and Alexander the Great, afterwards so
marvellously multiplied.</p>

<p>Respecting the primitive ancestry of these two princes, there were
different stories, but all concurred in tracing the origin of the
family to the Herakleid or Temenid race of Argos. According to one
story (which apparently cannot be traced higher than Theopompus),
Karanus, brother of the despot Pheidon, had migrated from Argos to
Macedonia, and established himself as conqueror at Edessa; according
to another tale, which we find in Herodotus, there were three exiles
of the Temenid race, Gauanês, Aëropus, and Perdikkas, who fled from
Argos to Illyria, from whence they passed into Upper Macedonia, in
such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[p. 17]</span> poverty as
to be compelled to serve the petty king of the town Lebæa in the
capacity of shepherds. A remarkable prodigy happening to Perdikkas
foreshadows the future eminence of his family, and leads to his
dismissal by the king of Lebæa,—from whom he makes his escape
with difficulty, by the sudden rise of a river immediately after
he had crossed it, so as to become impassable by the horsemen who
pursued him. To this river, as to the saviour of the family, solemn
sacrifices were still offered by the kings of Macedonia in the time
of Herodotus. Perdikkas with his two brothers having thus escaped,
established himself near the spot called the Garden of Midas on
Mount Bermius, and from the loins of this hardy young shepherd
sprang the dynasty of Edessa.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26"
class="fnanchor">[26]</a> This tale bears much more the marks of a
genuine local tradition than that of Theopompus. And the origin of
the Macedonian family, or Argeadæ, from Argos, appears to have been
universally recognized by Grecian inquirers,<a id="FNanchor_27"
href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>—so that Alexander
the son of Amyntas, the contemporary of the Persian invasion, was
admitted by the Hellanodikæ to contend at the Olympic games as a
genuine Greek, though his competitors sought to exclude him as a
Macedonian.</p>

<p>The talent for command was so much more the attribute of the
Greek mind than of any of the neighboring barbarians, that we easily
conceive a courageous Argeian adventurer acquiring to himself
great ascendency in the local disputes of the Macedonian tribes,
and transmitting the chieftainship of one of those tribes to his
offspring. The influence acquired by Miltiadês among the Thracians of
the Chersonese, and by Phormion among the Akarnanians (who specially
requested that, after his death, his son, or some one of his kindred,
might be sent from Athens to command them),<a id="FNanchor_28"
href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> was very much of
this character: we may add the case of Sertorius among the native
Iberians. In like manner, the kings of the Macedonian Lynkêstæ
professed to be descended from the Bacchiadæ<a id="FNanchor_29"
href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> of Corinth; and the
neighbor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[p. 18]</span>hood of
Epidamnus and Apollonia, in both of which doubtless members of
that great gens were domiciliated, renders this tale even more
plausible than that of an emigration from Argos. The kings of the
Epirotic Molossi pretended also to a descent from the heroic Æakid
race of Greece. In fact, our means of knowledge do not enable us
to discriminate the cases in which these reigning families were
originally Greeks, from those in which they were Hellenized natives
pretending to Grecian blood.</p>

<p>After the foundation-legend of the Macedonian kingdom, we
have nothing but a long blank until the reign of king Amyntas
(about 520-500 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), and his son
Alexander, (about 480 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>) Herodotus
gives us five successive kings between the founder Perdikkas
and Amyntas,—Perdikkas, Argæus, Philippus, Aëropus, Alketas,
Amyntas, and Alexander,—the contemporary and to a certain extent
the ally of Xerxês.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30"
class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Though we have no means of establishing
any dates in this early series, either of names or of facts,
yet we see that the Temenid kings, beginning from a humble
origin, extended their dominions successively on all sides. They
conquered the Briges,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31"
class="fnanchor">[31]</a>—originally their neighbors on Mount
Bermius,—the Eordi, bordering on Edessa to the westward, who were
either destroyed or expelled from the country, leaving a small
remnant still existing in the time of Thucydidês at Physka between
Strymon and Axius,—the Almopians, an inland tribe of unknown
site,—and many of the interior Macedonian tribes who had been at
first autonomous. Besides these inland conquests, they had made the
still more important acquisition of Pieria, the territory which
lay between Mount Bermius and the sea, from whence they expelled
the original Pierians, who found new seats on the eastern bank of
the Strymon between Mount Pangæus and the sea. Amyntas king of
Macedon was thus master of a very considerable territory,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[p. 19]</span> comprising the coast of
the Thermaic gulf as far north as the mouth of the Haliakmôn, and
also some other territory on the same gulf from which the Bottiæans
had been expelled; but not comprising the coast between the mouths
of the Axius and the Haliakmôn, nor even Pella, the subsequent
capital, which were still in the hands of the Bottiæans at the period
when Xerxês passed through.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32"
class="fnanchor">[32]</a> He possessed also Anthemus, a town and
territory in the peninsula of Chalkidikê, and some parts of Mygdonia,
the territory east of the mouth of the Axius; but how much, we do
not know. We shall find the Macedonians hereafter extending their
dominion still farther, during the period between the Persian and
Peloponnesian war.</p>

<p>We hear of king Amyntas in friendly connection with the
Peisistratid princes at Athens, whose dominion was in part sustained
by mercenaries from the Strymon, and this amicable sentiment was
continued between his son Alexander and the emancipated Athenians.<a
id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> It
is only in the reigns of these two princes that Macedonia begins
to be implicated in Grecian affairs: the regal dynasty had become
so completely Macedonized, and had so far renounced its Hellenic
brotherhood, that the claim of Alexander to run at the Olympic games
was contested by his competitors, and he was called upon to prove his
lineage before the Hellanodikæ.</p>

    THRACIANS AND GREEK COLONIES IN THRACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class="mt1"><span class="smcap">That</span> vast space comprised
between the rivers Strymon and Danube, and bounded to the west by the
easternmost Illyrian tribes, northward of the Strymon, was occupied
by the innumerable subdivisions of the race called Thracians, or
Threïcians. They were the most numerous and most terrible race known
to Herodotus: could they by possibility act in unison or under one
dominion (he says), they would be irresistible. A conjunction thus
formidable once seemed impending, during the first years of the
Peloponnesian war, under the reign of Sitalkês king of the Odrysæ,
who reigned from Abdêra at the mouth of the Nestus to the Euxine, and
compressed under his sceptre a large proportion of these ferocious
but warlike plunderers; so that the Greeks even down to Thermopylæ
trembled at his expected approach. But the abilities of that prince
were not found adequate to bring the whole force of Thrace into
effective coöperation and aggression against others.</p>

<p>Numerous as the tribes of Thracians were, their customs
and character (according to Herodotus) were marked by great
uniformity: of the Getæ, the Trausi, and others, he tells us a few
particularities. And the large tract over which the race were spread,
comprising as it did the whole chain of Mount Hæmus and the still
loftier chain of Rhodopê, together with a portion of the mountains
Orbêlus and Skomius, was yet partly occupied by level and fertile
surface,—such as the great plain of Adrianople, and the land towards
the lower course of the rivers Nestus and Hebrus. The Thracians of
the plain, though not less warlike, were at least more home-keeping,
and less greedy of foreign plunder, than those of the mountains. But
the general character of the race presents an aggregate of repulsive
features unredeemed by the presence of even the commonest domestic
affec<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[p. 21]</span>tions.<a
id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
The Thracian chief deduced his pedigree from a god called by the
Greeks Hermês, to whom he offered up worship apart from the rest
of his tribe, sometimes with the acceptable present of a human
victim. He tattooed his body,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35"
class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and that of the women belonging to him,
as a privilege of honorable descent: he bought his wives from their
parents, and sold his children for exportation to the foreign
merchant: he held it disgraceful to cultivate the earth, and felt
honored only by the acquisitions of war and robbery. The Thracian
tribes worshipped deities whom the Greeks assimilate to Arês,
Dionysus, and Artemis: the great sanctuary and oracle of their god
Dionysus was in one of the loftiest summits of Rhodopê, amidst dense
and foggy thickets,—the residence of the fierce and unassailable
Satræ. To illustrate the Thracian character, we may turn to a deed
perpetrated by the king of the Bisaltæ,—perhaps one out of several
chiefs of that extensive Thracian tribe,—whose territory, between
Strymon and Axius, lay in the direct march of Xerxês into Greece, and
who fled to the desolate heights of Rhodopê, to escape the ignominy
of being dragged along amidst the compulsory auxiliaries of the
Persian invasion, forbidding his six sons to take any part in it.
From recklessness, or curiosity, the sons disobeyed his commands,
and accompanied Xerxês into Greece; they returned unhurt by the
Greek spear; but the incensed father, when they again came into his
presence, caused the eyes of all of them to be put out. Exultation
of success manifested itself in the Thracians by increased alacrity
in shedding blood; but as warriors, the only occupation which they
esteemed, they were not less brave than patient of hardship, and
maintained a good front, under their own peculiar array, against
forces much superior in all military efficacy.<a id="FNanchor_36"
href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> It appears that
the Thynians and Bithy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[p.
22]</span>nians,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37"
class="fnanchor">[37]</a> on the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus,
perhaps also the Mysians, were members of this great Thracian race,
which was more remotely connected, also, with the Phrygians. And
the whole race may be said to present a character more Asiatic than
European, especially in those ecstatic and maddening religious
rites, which prevailed not less among the Edonian Thracians than
in the mountains of Ida and Dindymon of Asia, though with some
important differences. The Thracians served to furnish the Greeks
with mercenary troops and slaves, and the number of Grecian colonies
planted on the coast had the effect of partially softening the
tribes in the immediate vicinity, between whose chiefs and the
Greek leaders intermarriages were not unfrequent. But the tribes in
the interior seem to have retained their savage habits with little
mitigation, so that the language in which Tacitus<a id="FNanchor_38"
href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> describes them is an
apt continuation to that of Herodotus, though coming more than five
centuries after.</p>

<p>To note the situation of each one among these many different
tribes, in the huge territory of Thrace, which is even now so
imperfectly known and badly mapped, would be unnecessary, and,
indeed, impracticable. I shall proceed to mention the principal
Grecian colonies which were formed in the country, noticing
occasionally the particular Thracian tribes with which they came in
contact.</p>

<p>The Grecian colonies established on the Thermaic gulf, as well as
in the peninsula of Chalkidikê, emanating principally from Chalkis
and Eretria, though we do not know their precise epoch, appear to
have been of early date, and probably preceded the time when the
Macedonians of Edessa extended their conquests to the sea. At that
early period, they would find the Pierians still between the Peneius
and Haliakmôn,—also a number of petty Thracian tribes throughout
the broad part of the Chalkidic peninsula; they would find Pydna a
Pierian town, and Therma, Anthemus, Chalastra, etc. Mygdonian.</p>

<p>The most ancient Grecian colony in these regions seems to<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[p. 23]</span> have been Methônê,
founded by the Eretrians in Pieria; nearly at the same time (if we
may trust a statement of rather suspicious character, though the date
itself is noway improbable) as Korkyra was settled by the Corinthians
(about 730-720 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>).<a id="FNanchor_39"
href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> It was a little to the
north of the Pierian town of Pydna, and separated by about ten miles
from the Bottiæan town of Alôrus, which lay north of the Haliakmôn.<a
id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> We
know very little about Methônê, except that it preserved its autonomy
and its Hellenism until the time of Philip of Macedon, who took
and destroyed it. But though, when once established, it was strong
enough to maintain itself in spite of conquests made all around by
the Macedonians of Edessa, we may fairly presume that it could not
have been originally planted on Macedonian territory. Nor in point of
fact was the situation peculiarly advantageous for Grecian colonists,
inasmuch as there were other maritime towns, not Grecian, in its
neighborhood,—Pydna, Alôrus, Therma, Chalastra; whereas the point of
advantage for a Grecian colony was, to become the exclusive seaport
for inland indigenous people.</p>

<p>The colonies, founded by Chalkis and Eretria on all the three
projections of the Chalkidic peninsula, were numerous, though for a
long time inconsiderable. We do not know how far these projecting
headlands were occupied before the arrival of the settlers from
Eubœa,—an event which we may probably place at some period earlier
than 600 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>; for after that period
Chalkis and Eretria seem rather on the decline,—and it appears too,
that the Chalkidian colonists in Thrace aided their mother-city
Chalkis in her war against Eretria, which cannot be much later than
600 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, though it may be considerably
earlier.</p>

<p>The range of mountains which crosses from the Thermaic to the
Strymonic gulf, and forms the northern limit of the Chalkidic
peninsula, slopes down towards the southern extremity, so as to leave
a considerable tract of fertile land between the Torônaic and the
Thermaic gulfs, including the fertile headland called Pallênê,—the
westernmost of those three prongs of Chalkidikê which run out into
the Ægean. Of the other two prongs, or projections, the easternmost
is terminated by the sublime Mount Athos, which rises out of the sea
as a precipitous rock six thou<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[p.
24]</span>sand four hundred feet in height, connected with the
mainland by a ridge not more than half the height of the mountain
itself, yet still high, rugged, and woody from sea to sea, leaving
only little occasional spaces fit to be occupied or cultivated. The
intermediate or Sithonian headland is also hilly and woody, though in
a less degree,—both less inviting and less productive than Pallênê.<a
id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>Æneia, near that cape which marks the entrance of the inner
Thermaic gulf,—and Potidæa, at the narrow isthmus of Pallênê,—were
both founded by Corinth. Between these two towns lay the fertile
territory called Krusis, or Krossæa, forming in after-times
a part of the domain of Olynthus, but in the sixth century
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> occupied by petty Thracian townships.<a
id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Within
Pallênê were the towns of Mendê, a colony from Eretria,—Skiônê,
which, having no legitimate mother-city traced its origin to
Pellenian warriors returning from Troy,—Aphytis, Neapolis, Ægê,
Therambôs, and Sanê,<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43"
class="fnanchor">[43]</a> either wholly or partly colonies from
Eretria. In the Sithonian peninsula were Assa, Pilôrus, Singus,
Sartê, Torônê, Galêpsus, Sermylê, and Mekyberna; all or most of
these seem to have been of Chalkidic origin. But at the head of
the Torônaic gulf (which lies between Sithonia and Pallênê) was
placed Olynthus, surrounded by an extensive and fertile plain.
Originally a Bottiæan town, Olynthus will be seen at the time of the
Persian invasion to pass into the hands of the Chalkidian Greeks,<a
id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> and
gradually to incorporate with itself several of the petty neighboring
establishments belonging to that race; whereby the Chalkidians
acquired that marked preponderance in the peninsula which they
retained, even against the efforts of Athens, until the days of
Philip of Macedon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[p. 25]</span>On the scanty
spaces, admitted by the mountainous promontory, or ridge, ending
in Athos, were planted some Thracian and some Pelasgic settlements
of the same inhabitants as those who occupied Lemnos and Imbros; a
few Chalkidic citizens being domiciliated with them, and the people
speaking both Pelasgic and Hellenic. But near the narrow isthmus
which joins this promontory to Thrace, and along the north-western
coast of the Strymonic gulf, were Grecian towns of considerable
importance,—Sanê, Akanthus, Stageira, and Argilus, all colonies
from Andros, which had itself been colonized from Eretria.<a
id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
Akanthus and Stageira are said to have been founded in 654
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small></p>

<p>Following the southern coast of Thrace, from the mouth of the
river Strymôn towards the east, we may doubt whether, in the year
560 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, any considerable independent
colonies of Greeks had yet been formed upon it. The Ionic colony
of Abdêra, eastward of the mouth of the river Nestus, formed from
Teôs in Ionia, is of more recent date, though the Klazomenians<a
id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> had
begun an unsuccessful settlement there as early as the year 651
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>; while Dikæa—the Chian settlement
of Marôneia—and the Lesbian settlement of Ænus at the mouth of the
Hebrus, are of unknown date.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47"
class="fnanchor">[47]</a> The important and valuable territory near
the mouth of the Strymôn, where, after many ruinous failures,<a
id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> the
Athenian colony of Amphipolis afterwards maintained itself, was at
the date here mentioned possessed by Edonian Thracians and Pierians:
the various Thracian tribes,—Satræ, Edonians, Dersæans, Sapæans,
Bistones, Kikones, Pætians, etc.—were in force on the principal part
of the tract between Strymôn and Hebrus, even to the sea-coast. It
is to be remarked, however, that the island of Thasus, and that
of Samothrace, each possessed what in Greek was called a Peræa,<a
id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>—a
strip of the adjoining mainland cultivated and defended by means of
for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[p. 26]</span>tified posts, or
small towns: probably, these occupations are of very ancient date,
since they seem almost indispensable as a means of support to the
islands. For the barren Thasus, especially, merits even at this day
the uninviting description applied to it by the poet Archilochus,
in the seventh century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,—“an
ass’s backbone, overspread with wild wood:”<a id="FNanchor_50"
href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> so wholly is it
composed of mountain, naked or wooded, and so scanty are the patches
of cultivable soil left in it, nearly all close to the sea-shore.
This island was originally occupied by the Phenicians, who worked the
gold mines in its mountains with a degree of industry which, even in
its remains, excited the admiration of Herodotus. How and when it
was evacuated by them, we do not know; but the poet Archilochus<a
id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> formed
one of a body of Parian colonists who planted themselves on it in the
seventh century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, and carried on war,
not always successful, against the Thracian tribe called Saians: on
one occasion, Archilochus found himself compelled to throw away his
shield. By their mines and their possessions on the mainland (which
contained even richer mines, at Skaptê Hylê, and elsewhere, than
those in the island), the Thasian Greeks rose to considerable power
and population. And as they seem to have been the only Greeks, until
the settlement of the Milesian Histiæus on the Strymôn about 510
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, who actively concerned themselves
in the mining districts of Thrace opposite to their island, we cannot
be sur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[p. 27]</span>prised to
hear that their clear surplus revenue before the Persian conquest,
about 493 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, after defraying the
charges of their government without any taxation, amounted to the
large sum of two hundred talents, sometimes even to three hundred
talents, in each year (from forty-six thousand to sixty-six thousand
pounds).</p>

<p>On the long peninsula called the Thracian Chersonese there may
probably have been small Grecian settlements at an early date, though
we do not know at what time either the Milesian settlement of Kardia,
on the western side of the isthmus of that peninsula, near the Ægean
sea,—or the Æolic colony of Sestus on the Hellespont,—were founded;
while the Athenian ascendency in the peninsula begins only with the
migration of the first Miltiadês, during the reign of Peisistratus
at Athens. The Samian colony of Perinthus, on the northern
coast of the Propontis,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52"
class="fnanchor">[52]</a> is spoken of as ancient in date, and the
Megarian colonies, Selymbria and Byzantium, belong to the seventh
century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>: the latter of these two is
assigned to the 30th Olympiad (657 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>),
and its neighbor Chalkêdôn, on the opposite coast, was a few
years earlier. The site of Byzantium in the narrow strait of the
Bosphorus, with its abundant thunny-fishery,<a id="FNanchor_53"
href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> which both employed
and nourished a large proportion of the poorer freemen, was alike
convenient either for maritime traffic, or for levying contributions
on the numerous corn ships which passed from the Euxine into the
Ægean; and we are even told that it held a considerable number of the
neighboring Bithynian Thracians as tributary Periœki. Such dominion,
though probably maintained during the more vigorous period of Grecian
city life, became in later times impracticable, and we even find the
Byzantines not always competent to the defence of their own small
surrounding territory. The place, however, will be found to possess
considerable importance during all the period of this history.<a
id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>The Grecian settlements on the inhospitable south-western coast
of the Euxine, south of the Danube, appear never to have<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[p. 28]</span> attained any
consideration: the principal traffic of Greek ships in that sea
tended to more northerly ports, on the banks of the Borysthenês
and in the Tauric Chersonese. Istria was founded by the Milesians
near the southern embouchure of the Danube,—Apollonia and Odêssus
on the same coast, more to the south,—all probably between 600-560
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> The Megarian or Byzantine colony
of Mesambria, seems to have been later than the Ionic revolt;
of Kallatis the age is not known. Tomi, north of Kallatis and
south of Istria, is renowned as the place of Ovid’s banishment.<a
id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> The
picture which he gives of that uninviting spot, which enjoyed but
little truce from the neighborhood of the murderous Getæ, explains to
us sufficiently why these towns acquired little or no importance.</p>

<p>The islands of Lemnos and Imbros, in the Ægean, were at this early
period occupied by Tyrrhenian Pelasgi, were conquered by the Persians
about 508 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, and seem to have passed
into the power of the Athenians at the time when Ionia revolted from
the Persians. If the mythical or poetical stories respecting these
Tyrrhenian Pelasgi contain any basis of truth, they must have been
a race of buccaneers not less rapacious than cruel. At one time,
these Pelasgi seem also to have possessed Samothrace, but how or when
they were supplanted by Greeks, we find no trustworthy account; the
population of Samothrace at the time of the Persian war was Ionic.<a

    KYRENE AND BARKA. — HESPERIDES.</h2>
</div>

<p class="mt1"><span class="smcap">It has</span> been already
mentioned, in a former chapter, that Psammetichus king of Egypt,
about the middle of the seventh century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,
first removed those prohibitions which had excluded Grecian commerce
from his country. In his reign, Grecian mercenaries were first
established in Egypt, and Grecian traders admitted, under certain
regulations, into the Nile. The opening of this new market emboldened
them to traverse the direct sea which separates Krête from Egypt,—a
dangerous voyage with vessels which rarely ventured to lose sight
of land,—and seems to have first made them acquainted with the
neighboring coast of Libya, between the Nile and the gulf called the
Great Syrtis. Hence arose the foundation of the important colony
called Kyrênê.</p>

<p>As in the case of most other Grecian colonies, so in that
of Kyrênê, both the foundation and the early history are very
imperfectly known. The date of the event, as far as can be
made out amidst much contradiction of statement, was about 630
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>:<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57"
class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Thêra was the mother-city, herself a
colony from Lacedæmon; and the settlements formed in Libya became no
inconsiderable ornaments to the Dorian name in Hellas.</p>

<p>According to the account of a lost historian,
Meneklês,<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58"
class="fnanchor">[58]</a>—political dissension among the inhabitants
of Thêra led to that emigration which founded Kyrênê; and the
more ample legendary details which Herodotus collected, partly
from Theræan, partly from Kyrenæan informants, are not positively
inconsistent with this statement, though they indicate more
particularly bad seasons, distress, and over-population. Both of
them dwell emphatically on the Delphian oracle as the instigator
as well as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[p. 30]</span>
director of the first emigrants, whose apprehensions of a dangerous
voyage and an unknown country were very difficult to overcome. Both
of them affirmed that the original œkist Battus was selected and
consecrated to the work by the divine command: both called Battus
the son of Polymnêstus, of the mythical breed called Minyæ. But on
other points there was complete divergence between the two stories,
and the Kyrenæans themselves, whose town was partly peopled by
emigrants from Krête, described the mother of Battus as daughter of
Etearchus, prince of the Kretan town of Axus.<a id="FNanchor_59"
href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Battus had an
impediment in his speech, and it was on his intreating from the
Delphian oracle a cure for this infirmity that he received directions
to go as “a cattle-breeding œkist to Libya.” The suffering Theræans
were directed to assist him, but neither he nor they knew where Libya
was, nor could they find any resident in Krête who had ever visited
it. Such was the limited reach of Grecian navigation to the south
of the Ægean sea, even a century after the foundation of Syracuse.
At length, by prolonged inquiry, they discovered a man employed in
catching the purple shellfish, named Korôbius,—who said that he had
been once forced by stress of weather to the island of Platea, close
to the shores of Libya, and on the side not far removed from the
western limit of Egypt. Some Theræans being sent along with Korôbius
to inspect this island, left him there with a stock of provisions,
and returned to Thêra to conduct the emigrants. From the seven
districts into which Thêra was divided, emigrants were drafted for
the colony, one brother being singled out by lot from the different
numerous families. But so long was their return to Platea deferred,
that the provisions of Korôbius were exhausted, and he was only saved
from starvation by the accidental arrival of a Samian ship, driven
by contrary winds out of her course on the voyage to Egypt. Kôlæus,
the master of this ship (whose immense profits made by the first
voyage to Tartêssus have been noticed in a former chapter), supplied
him with provisions for a year,—an act of kindness, which is said
to have laid the first foundation of the alliance and good feeling
afterwards prevalent between Thêra, Kyrênê, and Samos. At length
the expected emigrants reached the island,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_31">[p. 31]</span> having found the voyage so perilous
and difficult, that they once returned in despair to Thêra, where
they were only prevented by force from relanding. The band which
accompanied Battus was all conveyed in two pentekonters,—armed ships,
with fifty rowers each. Thus humble was the start of the mighty
Kyrênê, which, in the days of Herodotus, covered a city-area equal to
the entire island of Platea.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60"
class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>That island, however, though near to Libya, and supposed by the
colonists to be Libya, was not so in reality: the commands of the
oracle had not been literally fulfilled. Accordingly, the settlement
carried with it nothing but hardship for the space of two years, and
Battus returned with his companions to Delphi, to complain that the
promised land had proved a bitter disappointment. The god, through
his priestess, returned for answer, “If you, who have never visited
the cattle-breeding Libya, know it better than I, who <i>have</i>, I
greatly admire your cleverness.” Again the inexorable mandate forced
them to return; and this time they planted themselves on the actual
continent of Libya, nearly over against the island of Platea, in
a district called Aziris, surrounded on both sides by fine woods,
and with a running stream adjoining. After six years of residence
in this spot, they were persuaded by some of the indigenous Libyans
to abandon it, under the promise that they should be conducted to a
better situation: and their guides now brought them to the actual
site of Kyrênê, saying, “Here, men of Hellas, is the place for
you to dwell, for here the sky is perforated.”<a id="FNanchor_61"
href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> The road through which
they passed had led through the tempting region of Irasa with its
fountain Thestê, and their guides took the precaution to carry them
through it by night, in order that they might remain ignorant of its
beauties.</p>

<p>Such were the preliminary steps, divine and human, which brought
Battus and his colonists to Kyrênê. In the time of Herodotus, Irasa
was an outlying portion of the eastern territory of this powerful
city. But we trace in the story just related an<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_32">[p. 32]</span> opinion prevalent among his Kyrenæan
informants, that Irasa with its fountain Thestê was a more inviting
position than Kyrênê with its fountain of Apollo, and ought in
prudence to have been originally chosen; out of which opinion,
according to the general habit of the Greek mind, an anecdote is
engendered and accredited, explaining how the supposed mistake was
committed. What may have been the recommendations of Irasa, we are
not permitted to know: but descriptions of modern travellers, no
less than the subsequent history of Kyrênê, go far to justify the
choice actually made. The city was placed at the distance of about
ten miles from the sea, having a sheltered port called Apollonia,
itself afterwards a considerable town,—it was about twenty miles
from the promontory Phykus, which forms the northernmost projection
of the African coast, nearly in the longitude of the Peloponnesian
Cape Tænarus (Matapan). Kyrênê was situated about eighteen hundred
feet above the level of the Mediterranean, of which it commanded a
fine view, and from which it was conspicuously visible, on the edge
of a range of hills which slope by successive terraces down to the
port. The soil immediately around, partly calcareous, partly sandy,
is described by Captain Beechey to present a vigorous vegetation and
remarkable fertility, though the ancients considered it inferior in
this respect both to Barka<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62"
class="fnanchor">[62]</a> and Hesperides, and still more inferior to
the more westerly region near Kinyps. But the abundant periodical
rains, attracted by the lofty heights around, and justifying the
expression of the “perforated sky,” were even of greater importance,
under an African sun, than extraordinary richness of soil.<a
id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
The maritime regions near Kyrênê and Barka,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_33">[p. 33]</span> and Hesperides, produced oil and wine
as well as corn, while the extensive district between these towns,
composed of alternate mountain, wood, and plain, was eminently
suited for pasture and cattle-breeding; and the ports were secure,
presenting conveniences for the intercourse of the Greek trader
with Northern Africa, such as were not to be found along all the
coasts of the Great Syrtis westward of Hesperides. Abundance of
applicable land,—great diversity both of climate and of productive
season, between the sea-side, the low hill, and the upper mountain,
within a small space, so that harvest was continually going on,
and fresh produce coming in from the earth, during eight months of
the year,—together with the monopoly of the valuable plant called
the Silphium, which grew nowhere except in the Kyrenaic region,
and the juice of which was extensively demanded throughout Greece
and Italy,—led to the rapid growth of Kyrênê, in spite of serious
and renewed political troubles. And even now, the immense remains
which still mark its desolate site, the evidences of past labor and
solicitude at the Fountain of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[p.
34]</span> Apollo, and elsewhere, together with the profusion of
excavated and ornamented tombs,—attest sufficiently what the grandeur
of the place must have been in the days of Herodotus and Pindar.
So much did the Kyrenæans pride themselves on the Silphium, found
wild in their back country, from the island of Platea on the east
to the inner recess of the Great Syrtis westward,—the leaves of
which were highly salubrious for cattle, and the stalk for man,
while the root furnished the peculiar juice for export,—that they
maintained it to have first appeared seven years prior to the arrival
of the first Grecian colonists in their city.<a id="FNanchor_64"
href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>But it was not only the properties of the soil which
promoted the prosperity of Kyrênê. Isokratês<a id="FNanchor_65"
href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> praises the well-chosen
site of that colony because it was planted in the midst of indigenous
natives apt for subjection, and far distant from any formidable
enemies. That the native Libyan tribes were made conducive in an
eminent degree to the growth of the Greco-Libyan cities, admits of
no doubt; and in reviewing the history of these cities, we must bear
in mind that their population was not pure Greek, but more or less
mixed, like that of the colonies in Italy, Sicily, or Ionia. Though
our information is very imperfect, we see enough to prove that the
small force brought over by Battus the Stammerer was enabled first
to fraternize with the indigenous Libyans,—next, reinforced by
additional colonists and availing themselves of the power of native
chiefs, to overawe and subjugate them. Kyrênê—combined with Barka
and Hesperides, both of them sprung from her root<a id="FNanchor_66"
href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>—exercised over the
Libyan tribes between the borders of Egypt and the inner recess
of the Great Syrtis, for a space of three degrees of longitude,
an ascen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[p. 35]</span>dency
similar to that which Carthage possessed over the more westerly
Libyans near the Lesser Syrtis. Within these Kyrenæan limits, and
further westward along the shores of the Great Syrtis, the Libyan
tribes were of pastoral habits; westward, beyond the Lake Tritônis
and the Lesser Syrtis,<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67"
class="fnanchor">[67]</a> they began to be agricultural.
Immediately westward of Egypt were the Adyrmachidæ, bordering upon
Apis and Marea, the Egyptian frontier towns;<a id="FNanchor_68"
href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> they were subject
to the Egyptians, and had adopted some of the minute ritual and
religious observances which characterized the region of the Nile.
Proceeding westward from the Adyrmachidæ were found the Giligammæ,
the Asbystæ, the Auschisæ, the Kabales, and the Nasamônes,—the latter
of whom occupied the south-eastern corner of the Great Syrtis;—next,
the Makæ, Gindânes, Lotophagi, Machlyes, as far as a certain river
and lake called Tritôn and Tritônis, which seems to have been near
the Lesser Syrtis. These last-mentioned tribes were not dependent
either on Kyrênê or on Carthage, at the time of Herodotus, nor
probably during the proper period of free Grecian history, (600-300
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>) In the third century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,
the Ptolemaic governors of Kyrênê
extended their dominion westward, while Carthage pushed her colonies
and castles eastward, so that the two powers embraced between them
the whole line of coast between the Greater and Lesser Syrtis,
meeting at the spot called the Altars of the Brothers Philæni,—so
celebrated for its commemorative legend.<a id="FNanchor_69"
href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> But even in the sixth
century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, Carthage was jealous
of the extension of Grecian colonies along this coast, and aided
the Libyan Makæ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[p. 36]</span>
(about 510 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>) to expel the Spartan
prince Dorieus from his settlement near the river Kinyps. Near that
spot was afterwards planted, by Phenician or Carthaginian exiles,
the town of Leptis Magna<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70"
class="fnanchor">[70]</a> (now Lebida), which does not seem to have
existed in the time of Herodotus. Nor does the latter historian
notice the Marmaridæ, who appear as the principal Libyan tribe near
the west of Egypt, between the age of Skylax and the third century
of the Christian era. Some migration or revolution subsequent to the
time of Herodotus must have brought this name into predominance.<a
id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>The interior country, stretching westward from Egypt along the
thirtieth and thirty-first parallel of latitude, to the Great Syrtis,
and then along the southern shore of that gulf, is to a great degree
low and sandy, and quite destitute of trees; yet affording in
many parts water, herbage, and a fertile soil.<a id="FNanchor_72"
href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> But the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[p. 37]</span> maritime region north
of this, constituting the projecting bosom of the African coast
from the island of Platea (Gulf of Bomba) on the east to Hesperides
(Bengazi) on the west, is of a totally different character; covered
with mountains of considerable elevation, which reach their highest
point near Kyrênê, interspersed with productive plain and valley,
broken by frequent ravines which carry off the winter torrents into
the sea, and never at any time of the year destitute of water.
It is this latter advantage that causes them to be now visited
every summer by the Bedouin Arabs, who flock to the inexhaustible
Fountain of Apollo and to other parts of the mountainous region
from Kyrênê to Hesperides, when their supply of water and herbage
fails in the interior:<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73"
class="fnanchor">[73]</a> and the same circumstance must have<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[p. 38]</span> operated in ancient times
to hold the nomadic Libyans in a sort of dependence on Kyrênê and
Barka. Kyrênê appropriated the maritime portion of the territory
of the Libyan Asbystæ;<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74"
class="fnanchor">[74]</a> the Auschisæ occupied the region south
of Barka, touching the sea near Hesperides,—the Kabales near
Teucheira in the territory of Barka. Over the interior spaces
these Libyan Nomads, with their cattle and twisted tents, wandered
unrestrained, amply fed upon meat and milk,<a id="FNanchor_75"
href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> clothed in goatskins,
and enjoying better health than any people known to Herodotus. Their
breed of horses was excellent, and their chariots or wagons with
four horses could perform feats admired even by Greeks: it was to
these horses that the princes<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76"
class="fnanchor">[76]</a> and magnates of Kyrênê and Barka often owed
the success of their chariots in the games of Greece. The Libyan
Nasamônes, leaving their cattle near the sea, were in the habit of
making an annual journey up the country to the Oasis of Augila, for
the purpose of gathering the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[p.
39]</span> date-harvest,<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77"
class="fnanchor">[77]</a> or of purchasing dates,—a journey which the
Bedouin Arabs from Bengazi still make annually, carrying up their
wheat and barley, for the same purpose. Each of the Libyan tribes was
distinguished by a distinct mode of cutting the hair, and by some
peculiarities of religious worship, though generally all worshipped
the Sun and the Moon.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78"
class="fnanchor">[78]</a> But in the neighborhood of the Lake
Tritônis (seemingly the western extremity of Grecian coasting trade
in the time of Herodotus, who knows little beyond, and begins to
appeal to Carthaginian authorities), the Grecian deities Poseidôn
and Athênê, together with the legend of Jason and the Argonauts, had
been localized. There were, moreover, current prophecies announcing
that one hundred Hellenic cities were destined one day to be founded
round the lake,—and that one city in the island Phla, surrounded by
the lake, was to be planted by the Lacedæmonians.<a id="FNanchor_79"
href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> These, indeed, were
among the many unfulfilled prophecies which from every side cheated
the Grecian ear,—proceeding in this case probably from Kyrenæan or
Theræan traders, who thought the spot advantageous for settlement,
and circulated their own hopes under the form of divine assurances.
It was about the year 510 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small><a
id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> that
some of these Theræans conducted the Spartan prince Dorieus to found
a colony in the fertile region of Kinyps, belonging to the Libyan
Makæ. But Carthage, interested in preventing the extension of Greek
settlements westward, aided the Libyans in driving him out.</p>

<p>The Libyans in the immediate neighborhood of Kyrênê were
materially changed by the establishment of that town, and constituted
a large part—at first, probably, far the largest part—of its
constituent population. Not possessing that fierce tenacity of habits
which the Mohammedan religion has impressed upon the Arabs of the
present day, they were open to the mingled influence of constraint
and seduction applied by Grecian settlers; so that in the time
of Herodotus, the Kabales and the Asbystæ<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_40">[p. 40]</span> of the interior had come to copy
Kyrenæan tastes and customs.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81"
class="fnanchor">[81]</a> The Theræan colonists, having obtained
not merely the consent but even the guidance of the natives to
their occupation of Kyrênê, constituted themselves like privileged
Spartan citizens in the midst of Libyan Periœki.<a id="FNanchor_82"
href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> They seem to have
married Libyan wives, whence Herodotus describes the women of Kyrênê
and Barka as following, even in his time, religious observances
indigenous and not Hellenic.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83"
class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Even the descendants of the primitive
œkist Battus were semi-Libyan. For Herodotus gives us the curious
information that Battus was the Libyan word for a king, deducing
from it the just inference, that the name Battus was not originally
personal to the œkist, but acquired in Libya first as a title,<a
id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>—and
that it afterwards passed to his descendants as a proper name.
For eight generations the reigning princes were called Battus and
Arkesilaus, the Libyan denomination alternating with the Greek, until
the family was finally deprived of its power. Moreover, we find the
chief of Barka, kinsman of Arkesilaus of Kyrênê bearing the name
of Alazir; a name certainly not Hellenic, and probably Libyan.<a
id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
We are, therefore, to conceive the first Theræan colonists as
established in their lofty fortified post Kyrênê, in the centre of
Libyan Periœki, till then strangers to walls, to arts, and perhaps
even to cultivated land. Probably these Periœki were always subject
and tributary, in a greater or less degree, though they continued for
half a century to retain their own king.</p>

<p>To these rude men the Theræans communicated the elements of
Hellenism and civilization, not without receiving themselves much
that was non-Hellenic in return; and perhaps the reactionary
influence of the Libyan element against the Hellenic might have
proved the stronger of the two, had they not been reinforced
by new-comers from Greece. After forty years of Battus<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[p. 41]</span> the œkist (about
630-590 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), and sixteen years of his son
Arkesilaus (about 590-574 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>),
a second Battus<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86"
class="fnanchor">[86]</a> succeeded, called Battus the Prosperous,
to mark the extraordinary increase of Kyrênê during his presidency.
The Kyrenæans under him took pains to invite new settlers from all
parts of Greece without distinction,—a circumstance deserving notice
in Grecian colonization, which usually manifested a preference for
certain races, if it did not positively exclude the rest. To every
new-comer was promised a lot of land, and the Delphian priestess
strenuously seconded the wishes of the Kyrenæans, proclaiming that
“whosoever should reach the place too late for the land-division,
would have reason to repent it.” Such promise of new land, as
well as the sanction of the oracle, were doubtless made public at
all the games and meetings of Greeks, and a large number of new
colonists embarked for Kyrênê. The exact number is not mentioned,
but we must conceive it to have been very great, when we are told
that during the succeeding generation, not less than seven thousand
Grecian hoplites of Kyrênê perished by the hands of the revolted
Libyans,—yet leaving both the city itself and its neighbor Barka
still powerful. The loss of so great a number as seven thousand
Grecian hoplites has very few parallels throughout the whole history
of Greece. In fact, this second migration, during the government of
Battus the Prosperous, which must have taken place between 574-554
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, ought to be looked upon as
the moment of real and effective colonization for Kyrênê. It was on
this occasion, probably, that the port of Apollonia, which afterwards
came to equal the city itself in importance, was first occupied and
fortified,—for this second swarm of emigrants came by sea direct,
while the original colonists had reached Kyrênê by land from the
island of Platea through Irasa. The fresh emigrants came from
Peloponnesus, Krete, and some other islands of the Ægean.</p>

<p>To furnish so many new lots of land, it was either necessary, or
it was deemed expedient, to dispossess many of the Libyan Periœki,
who found their situation in other respects also greatly<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[p. 42]</span> changed for the worse.
The Libyan king Adikran, himself among the sufferers, implored aid
from Apriês king of Egypt, then in the height of his power; sending
to declare himself and his people Egyptian subjects, like their
neighbors the Adyrmachidæ. The Egyptian prince, accepting the offer,
despatched a large military force of the native soldier-caste,
who were constantly in station at the western frontier-town
Marea, by the route along shore to attack Kyrênê. They were met
at Irasa by the Greeks of Kyrênê, and, being totally ignorant of
Grecian arms and tactics, experienced a defeat so complete that
few of them reached home.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87"
class="fnanchor">[87]</a> The consequences of this disaster in Egypt,
where it caused the transfer of the throne from Apriês to Amasis,
have been noticed in a former chapter.</p>

<p>Of course the Libyan Periœki were put down, and the redivision
of lands near Kyrênê among the Greek settlers accomplished, to the
great increase of the power of the city. And the reign of Battus
the Prosperous marks a flourishing era in the town, and a large
acquisition of land-dominion, antecedent to years of dissension and
distress. The Kyrenæans came into intimate alliance with Amasis
king of Egypt, who encouraged Grecian connection in every way,
and who even took to wife Ladikê, a woman of the Battiad family
at Kyrênê, so that the Libyan Periœki lost all chance of Egyptian
aid against the Greeks.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88"
class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>New prospects, however, were opened to them during the reign
of Arkesilaus the Second, son of Battus the Prosperous, (about
554-544 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>). The behavior of this
prince incensed and alienated his own brothers, who raised a revolt
against him, seceded with a portion of the citizens, and induced a
number of the Libyan Periœki to take part with them. They founded
the Greco-Libyan city of Barka, in the territory of the Libyan
Auschisæ, about twelve miles from the coast, distant from Kyrênê by
sea about seventy miles to the westward. The space between the two,
and even beyond Barka, as far as the more westerly Grecian colony
called Hesperides, was in the days of Skylax provided with commodious
ports for refuge or landing:<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89"
class="fnanchor">[89]</a> at what<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_43">[p. 43]</span> time Hesperides was founded we do not
know, but it existed about 510 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small><a
id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
Whether Arkesilaus obstructed the foundation of Barka is not certain;
but he marched the Kyrenæan forces against those revolted Libyans
who had joined it. Unable to resist, the latter fled for refuge
to their more easterly brethren near the borders of Egypt, and
Arkesilaus pursued them. At length, in a district called Leukôn, the
fugitives found an opportunity of attacking him at such prodigious
advantage, that they almost destroyed the Kyrenæan army, seven
thousand hoplites (as has been before intimated) being left dead on
the field. Arkesilaus did not long survive this disaster. He was
strangled during sickness by his brother Learchus, who aspired to the
throne; but Eryxô, widow of the deceased prince,<a id="FNanchor_91"
href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> avenged the crime, by
causing Learchus to be assassinated.</p>

<p>That the credit of the Battiad princes was impaired by such a
series of disasters and enormities, we can readily believe. But it
received a still greater shock from the circumstance, that Battus
the Third, son and successor of Arkesilaus, was lame and deformed in
his feet. To be governed by a man thus personally disabled, was in
the minds of the Kyrenæans an indignity not to be borne, as well as
an excuse for preëxisting discontents; and the resolution was taken
to send to the Delphian oracle for advice. They were directed by
the priestess to invite from Mantineia, a moderator, empowered to
close discussions and provide a scheme of government,—the Mantineans
selecting Demônax, one of the wisest of their citizens, to solve
the same problem which had been committed to Solon at Athens. By
his arrangement, the regal prerogative of the Battiad line was
terminated, and a republican government established seemingly
about 543 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>; the dispossessed
prince retaining both the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[p.
44]</span> landed domains<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92"
class="fnanchor">[92]</a> and the various sacerdotal functions which
had belonged to his predecessors.</p>

<p>Respecting the government, as newly framed, however, Herodotus
unfortunately gives us hardly any particulars. Demônax classified
the inhabitants of Kyrênê into three tribes; composed of: 1.
Theræans with their Libyan Periœki; 2. Greeks who had come from
Peloponnesus and Krete; 3. Such Greeks as had come from all other
islands in the Ægean. It appears, too, that a senate was constituted,
taken doubtless from these three tribes, and we may presume, in
equal proportion. It seems probable that there had been before no
constitutional classification, nor political privilege, except what
was vested in the Theræans,—that these latter, the descendants of
the original colonists were the only persons hitherto <i>known to the
constitution</i>,—and that the remaining Greeks, though free landed
proprietors and hoplites, were not permitted to act as an integral
part of the body politic, nor distributed in tribes at all.<a
id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> The
whole powers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[p. 45]</span> of
government,—up to this time vested in the Battiad princes, subject
only to such check, how effective we know not, which the citizens
of Theræan origin might be able to interpose,—were now transferred
from the prince to the people; that is, to certain individuals or
assemblies chosen somehow from among all the citizens. There existed
at Kyrênê, as at Thêra and Sparta, a board of Ephors, and a band of
three hundred armed police,<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94"
class="fnanchor">[94]</a> analogous to those who were called the
Hippeis, or Horsemen, at Sparta: whether these were instituted by
Demônax, we do not know, nor does the identity of titular office, in
different states, afford safe ground for inferring identity of power.
This is particularly to be remarked with regard to the Periœki at
Kyrênê, who were perhaps more analogous to the Helots than to the
Periœki of Sparta. The fact that the Periœki were considered in the
new constitution as belonging specially to the Theræan branch of
citizens, shows that these latter still continued a privileged order,
like the Patricians with their Clients at Rome in relation to the
Plebs.</p>

<p>That the rearrangement introduced by Demônax was wise, consonant
to the general current of Greek feeling, and calculated to work well,
there is good reason to believe: and no discontent within would
have subverted it without the aid of extraneous force. Battus the
Lame acquiesced in it peaceably during his life; but his widow and
his son, Pheretimê and Arkesilaus, raised a revolt after his death,
and tried to regain by force the kingly privileges of the family.
They were worsted and obliged to flee,—the mother to Cyprus, the
son to Samos,—where both employed themselves in procuring foreign
arms to invade and conquer Kyrênê. Though Pheretimê could obtain no
effective aid from Euelthôn prince of Salamis in Cyprus, her son
was more successful in Samos, by inviting new Greek settlers to
Kyrênê, under promise of a redistribution of the land. A large<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[p. 46]</span> body of emigrants
joined him on this promise; the period seemingly being favorable to
it, since the Ionian cities had not long before become subject to
Persia, and were discontented with the yoke. But before he conducted
this numerous band against his native city, he thought proper to
ask the advice of the Delphian oracle. Success in the undertaking
was promised to him, but moderation and mercy after success was
emphatically enjoined, on pain of losing his life; and the Battiad
race was declared by the god to be destined to rule at Kyrênê for
eight generations, but no longer,—as far as four princes named Battus
and four named Arkesilaus.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95"
class="fnanchor">[95]</a> “More than such eight generations (said
the Pythia), Apollo forbids the Battiads even to aim at.” This
oracle was doubtless told to Herodotus by Kyrenæan informants when
he visited their city after the final deposition of the Battiad
princes, which took place in the person of the fourth Arkesilaus,
between 460-450 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>; the invasion of
Kyrênê by Arkesilaus the Third, sixth prince of the Battiad race,
to which the oracle professed to refer, having occurred about 530
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> The words placed in the mouth of
the priestess doubtless date from the later of these two periods,
and afford a specimen of the way in which pretended prophecies are
not only made up by antedating after-knowledge, but are also so
contrived as to serve a present purpose. For the distinct prohibition
of the god, “not even to aim at a longer lineage than eight Battiad
princes,” seems plainly intended to deter the partisans of the
dethroned family from endeavoring to reinstate them.</p>

<p>Arkesilaus the Third, to whom this prophecy purports to have
been addressed, returned with his mother Pheretimê and his army of
new colonists to Kyrênê. He was strong enough to carry all before
him,—to expel some of his chief opponents and seize upon others, whom
he sent to Cyprus to be destroyed; though the vessels were driven
out of their course by storms to the peninsula of Knidus, where the
inhabitants rescued the prisoners and sent them to Thêra. Other
Kyrenæans, opposed to the Battiads, took refuge in a lofty private
tower, the property<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[p. 47]</span>
of Aglômachus, wherein Arkesilaus caused them all to be burned,
heaping wood around and setting it on fire. But after this career
of triumph and revenge, he became conscious that he had departed
from the mildness enjoined to him by the oracle, and sought to avoid
the punishment which it had threatened by retiring from Kyrênê. At
any rate, he departed from Kyrênê to Barka, to the residence of the
Barkæan prince, his kinsman Alazir, whose daughter he had married.
But he found in Barka some of the unfortunate men who had fled from
Kyrênê to escape him: these exiles, aided by a few Barkæans, watched
for a suitable moment to assail him in the market-place, and slew
him, together with his kinsman the prince Alazir.<a id="FNanchor_96"
href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>The victory of Arkesilaus at Kyrênê, and his assassination
at Barka, are doubtless real facts; but they seem to have been
compressed together and incorrectly colored, in order to give to the
death of the Kyrenæan prince the appearance of a divine judgment. For
the reign of Arkesilaus cannot have been very short, since events of
the utmost importance occurred within it. The Persians under Kambysês
conquered Egypt, and both the Kyrenæan and the Barkæan prince sent
to Memphis to make their submission to the conqueror,—offering
presents and imposing upon themselves an annual tribute. The presents
of the Kyrenæans, five hundred minæ of silver, were considered by
Kambysês so contemptibly small, that he took hold of them at once
and threw them among his soldiers. And at the moment when Arkesilaus
died, Aryandes, the Persian satrap after the death of Kambysês, is
found established in Egypt.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97"
class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>During the absence of Arkesilaus at Barka, his mother Pheretimê
had acted as regent, taking her place at the discussions in the
senate; but when his death took place, and the feeling against the
Battiads manifested itself strongly at Barka, she did not feel
powerful enough to put it down, and went to Egypt to solicit aid from
Aryandes. The satrap, being made to believe that Arkesilaus had met
his death in consequence of steady devotion to the Persians, sent a
herald to Barka to demand the men who had slain him. The Barkæans
assumed the collective<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[p.
48]</span> responsibility of the act, saying that he had done them
injuries both numerous and severe,—a farther proof that his reign
cannot have been very short. On receiving this reply, the satrap
immediately despatched a powerful Persian armament, land-force
as well as sea-force, in fulfilment of the designs of Pheretimê
against Barka. They besieged the town for nine months, trying to
storm, to batter, and to undermine the walls;<a id="FNanchor_98"
href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> but their efforts
were vain, and it was taken at last only by an act of the grossest
perfidy. Pretending to relinquish the attempt in despair, the
Persian general concluded a treaty with the Barkæans, wherein it
was stipulated that the latter should continue to pay tribute to
the Great King, but that the army should retire without farther
hostilities: “I swear it (said the Persian general), and my oath
shall hold good, as long as this earth shall keep its place.” But
the spot on which the oaths were exchanged had been fraudulently
prepared: a ditch had been excavated and covered with hurdles, upon
which again a surface of earth had been laid. The Barkæans, confiding
in the oath, and overjoyed at their liberation, immediately opened
their gates and relaxed their guard; while the Persians, breaking
down the hurdles and letting fall the superimposed earth, so that
they might comply with the letter of their oath, assaulted the city
and took it without difficulty.</p>

<p>Miserable was the fate which Pheretimê had in reserve for these
entrapped prisoners. She crucified the chief opponents of herself and
her late son around the walls, on which were also affixed the breasts
of their wives: then, with the exception of such of the inhabitants
as were Battiads, and noway concerned in the death of Arkesilaus,
she consigned the rest to slavery in Persia. They were carried away
captive into the Persian empire, where Darius assigned to them a
village in Baktria as their place of abode, which still bore the name
of Barka, even in the days of Herodotus.</p>

<p>During the course of this expedition, it appears, the Persian army
advanced as far as Hesperides, and reduced many of the Libyan tribes
to subjection: these, together with Kyrênê and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_49">[p. 49]</span> Barka, figure among the tributaries and
auxiliaries of Xerxês in his expedition against Greece. And when
the army returned to Egypt, by order of Aryandês, they were half
inclined to seize Kyrênê itself in their way, though the opportunity
was missed and the purpose left unaccomplished.<a id="FNanchor_99"
href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>Pheretimê accompanied the retreating army to Egypt, where she
died shortly of a loathsome disease, consumed by worms; thus
showing, says Herodotus,<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100"
class="fnanchor">[100]</a> that “excessive cruelty in revenge brings
down upon men the displeasure of the gods.” It will be recollected
that in the veins of this savage woman the Libyan blood was
intermixed with the Grecian. Political enmity in Greece proper kills,
but seldom if ever mutilates or sheds the blood, of women.</p>

<p>We thus leave Kyrênê and Barka again subject to Battiad
princes, at the same time that they are tributaries of Persia.
Another Battus and another Arkesilaus have to intervene before
the glass of this worthless dynasty is run out, between 460-450
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> I shall not at present carry the reader’s
attention to this last Arkesilaus, who stands honored by two chariot
victories in Greece, and two fine odes of Pindar.</p>

<p>The victory of the third Arkesilaus, and the restoration of
the Battiads, broke up the equitable constitution established by
Demônax. His triple classification into tribes must have been
completely remodelled, though we do not know how. For the number
of new colonists whom Arkesilaus introduced must have necessitated
a fresh distribution of land, and it is extremely doubtful whether
the relation of the Theræan class of citizens with their Periœki, as
established by Demônax, still continued to subsist. It is necessary
to notice this fact, because the arrangements of Demônax are spoken
of by some authors as if they formed the permanent constitution of
Kyrênê; whereas they cannot have outlived the restoration of the
Battiads, nor can they even have been revived after that dynasty was
finally expelled, since the number of new citizens and the large
change of property, introduced by Arkesilaus the Third, would render
them inapplicable to the subsequent city.</p>

  <h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />
    PAN-HELLENIC FESTIVALS — OLYMPIC, PYTHIAN, NEMEAN, AND&nbsp;ISTHMIAN.</h2>
</div>

<p class="mt1"><span class="smcap">In the</span> preceding chapters
I have been under the necessity of presenting to the reader a
picture altogether incoherent and destitute of central effect,—to
specify briefly each of the two or three hundred towns which agreed
in bearing the Hellenic name, and to recount its birth and early
life, as far as our evidence goes,—but without being able to point
out any action and reaction, exploits or sufferings, prosperity or
misfortune, glory or disgrace, common to all. To a great degree,
this is a characteristic inseparable from the history of Greece from
its beginning to its end, for the only political unity which it ever
receives is the melancholy unity of subjection under all-conquering
Rome. Nothing short of force will efface in the mind of a free Greek
the idea of his city as an autonomous and separate organization; the
village is a fraction, but the city is an unit,—and the highest of
all political units, not admitting of being consolidated with others
into a ten or a hundred, to the sacrifice of its own separate and
individual mark. Such is the character of the race, both in their
primitive country and in their colonial settlements,—in their early
as well as in their late history,—splitting by natural fracture
into a multitude of self-administering, indivisible cities. But
that which marks the early historical period before Peisistratus,
and which impresses upon it an incoherence at once so fatiguing
and so irremediable, is, that as yet no causes have arisen to
counteract this political isolation. Each city, whether progressive
or stationary, prudent or adventurous, turbulent or tranquil, follows
out its own thread of existence, having no partnership or common
purposes with the rest, and not yet constrained into any active
partnership with them by extraneous forces. In like manner, the races
which on every side surround the Hellenic world appear distinct
and unconnected, not yet taken up into any coöperating mass or
system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[p. 51]</span>Contemporaneously
with the accession of Peisistratus, this state of things becomes
altered both in and out of Hellas,—the former as a consequence of the
latter: for at that time begins the formation of the great Persian
empire, which absorbs into itself not only Upper Asia and Asia Minor,
but also Phenicia, Egypt, Thrace, Macedonia, and a considerable
number of the Grecian cities themselves; and the common danger,
threatening the greater states of Greece proper from this vast
aggregate, drives them, in spite of great reluctance and jealousy,
into active union. Hence arises a new impulse, counterworking the
natural tendency to political isolation in the Hellenic cities,
and centralizing their proceedings to a certain extent for the two
centuries succeeding 560 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>; Athens and
Sparta both availing themselves of the centralizing tendencies which
had grown out of the Persian war. But during the interval between
776-560 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, no such tendency can be
traced even in commencement, nor any constraining force calculated
to bring it about. Even Thucydidês, as we may see by his excellent
preface, knew of nothing during these two centuries except separate
city-politics and occasional wars between neighbors: the only event,
according to him, in which any considerable number of Grecian cities
were jointly concerned, was the war between Chalkis and Eretria, the
date of which we do not know. In this war, several cities took part
as allies; Samos, among others, with Eretria,—Milêtus with Chalkis:<a
id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> how
far the alliances of either may have extended, we have no evidence
to inform us, but the presumption is that no great number of Grecian
cities was comprehended in them. Such as it was, however, this war
between Chalkis and Eretria was the nearest approach, and the only
approach, to a Pan-Hellenic proceeding which Thucydidês indicates
between the Trojan and the Persian wars. Both he and Herodotus
present this early period only by way of preface and contrast to
that which follows,—when the Pan-Hellenic spirit and tendencies,
though never at any time predominant, yet counted for a powerful
element in history, and sensibly modified the universal instinct of
city-isolation. They tell us little about it, either because they
could find no trustworthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[p.
52]</span> informants, or because there was nothing in it to
captivate the imagination in the same manner as the Persian or the
Peloponnesian wars. From whatever cause their silence arises, it is
deeply to be regretted, since the phenomena of the two centuries from
776-560 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, though not susceptible of
any central grouping, must have presented the most instructive matter
for study, had they been preserved. In no period of history have
there ever been formed a greater number of new political communities,
under such variety of circumstances, personal as well as local. And a
few chronicles, however destitute of philosophy, reporting the exact
march of some of these colonies from their commencement,—amidst all
the difficulties attendant on amalgamation with strange natives, as
well as on a fresh distribution of land,—would have added greatly to
our knowledge both of Greek character and Greek social existence.</p>

<p>Taking the two centuries now under review, then, it will appear
that there is not only no growing political unity among the Grecian
states, but a tendency even to the contrary,—to dissemination and
mutual estrangement. Not so, however, in regard to the other feelings
of unity capable of subsisting between men who acknowledge no
common political authority,—sympathies founded on common religion,
language, belief of race, legends, tastes and customs, intellectual
appetencies, sense of proportion and artistic excellence, recreative
enjoyments, etc. On all these points the manifestations of Hellenic
unity become more and more pronounced and comprehensive, in spite
of increased political dissemination, throughout the same period.
The breadth of common sentiment and sympathy between Greek and
Greek, together with the conception of multitudinous periodical
meetings as an indispensable portion of existence, appears decidedly
greater in 560 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> than it had been a
century before. It was fostered by the increased conviction of the
superiority of Greeks as compared with foreigners,—a conviction
gradually more and more justified as Grecian art and intellect
improved, and as the survey of foreign countries became extended,—as
well as by the many new efforts of men of genius in the field of
music, poetry, statuary, and architecture, each of whom touched
chords of feeling belonging to other Greeks hardly less than to
his own peculiar city. At the same time, the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_53">[p. 53]</span> life of each peculiar city continues
distinct, and even gathers to itself a greater abundance of facts
and internal interests. So that during the two centuries now under
review there was in the mind of every Greek an increase both of
the city-feeling and of the Pan-Hellenic feeling, but on the other
hand a decline of the old sentiment of separate race,—Doric, Ionic,
Æolic.</p>

<p>I have already, in my former volume, touched upon the many-sided
character of the Grecian religion, entering as it did into all the
enjoyments and sufferings, the hopes and fears, the affections and
antipathies, of the people,—not simply imposing restraints and
obligations, but protecting, multiplying, and diversifying all the
social pleasures and all the decorations of existence. Each city and
even each village had its peculiar religious festivals, wherein the
sacrifices to the gods were usually followed by public recreations of
one kind or other,—by feasting on the victims, processional marches,
singing and dancing, or competition in strong and active exercises.
The festival was originally local, but friendship or communion
of race was shown by inviting others, non-residents, to partake
in its attractions. In the case of a colony and its metropolis,
it was a frequent practice that citizens of the metropolis were
honored with a privileged seat at the festivals of the colony, or
that one of their number was presented with the first taste of
the sacrificial victim.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102"
class="fnanchor">[102]</a> Reciprocal frequentation of religious
festivals was thus the standing evidence of friendship and fraternity
among cities not politically united. That it must have existed to a
certain degree from the earliest days, there can be no reasonable
doubt; though in Homer and Hesiod we find only the celebration of
funeral games, by a chief at his own private expense, in honor
of his deceased father or friend,—with all the accompanying
recreations, however, of a public festival, and with strangers not
only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[p. 54]</span> present,
but also contending for valuable prizes.<a id="FNanchor_103"
href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Passing to historical
Greece during the seventh century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,
we find evidence of two festivals, even then very considerable, and
frequented by Greeks from many different cities and districts,—the
festival at Delos, in honor of Apollo, the great place of meeting
for Ionians throughout the Ægean,—and the Olympic games. The
Homeric Hymn to the Delian Apollo, which must be placed earlier
than 600 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, dwells with emphasis on
the splendor of the Delian festival,—unrivalled throughout Greece,
as it would appear, during all the first period of this history,
for wealth, finery of attire, and variety of exhibitions as well
in poetical genius as in bodily activity,<a id="FNanchor_104"
href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>—equalling probably
at that time, if not surpassing, the Olympic games. The complete
and undiminished grandeur of this Delian Pan-Ionic festival is one
of our chief marks of the first period of Grecian history, before
the comparative prostration of the Ionic Greeks through the rise
of Persia: it was celebrated periodically in every fourth year,
to the honor of Apollo and Artemis. It was distinguished from the
Olympic games by two circumstances both deserving of notice,—first,
by including solemn matches not only of gymnastic, but also of
musical and poetical excellence, whereas the latter had no place
at Olympia; secondly, by the admission of men, women, and children
indiscriminately as spectators, whereas women were formally excluded
from the Olympic ceremony.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105"
class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Such exclusion may have depended in part
on the inland situation of Olympia, less easily approachable by
females than the island of Delos; but even making allowance for this
circumstance, both the one distinction and the other mark the rougher
character of the Ætolo-Dorians in Peloponnesus. The Delian festival,
which greatly dwindled away during the subjection of the Asiatic and
insular Greeks to Persia, was revived afterwards by Athens during the
period of her empire, when she was seeking in every way to strengthen
her central ascendency in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[p.
55]</span> Ægean. But though it continued to be ostentatiously
celebrated under her management, it never regained that commanding
sanctity and crowded frequentation which we find attested in the
Homeric Hymn to Apollo for its earlier period.</p>

<p>Very different was the fate of the Olympic festival,—on the
banks of the Alpheius<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106"
class="fnanchor">[106]</a> in Peloponnesus, near the old oracular
temple of the Olympian Zeus,—which not only grew up uninterruptedly
from small beginnings to the maximum of Pan-Hellenic importance,
but even preserved its crowds of visitors and its celebrity for
many centuries after the extinction of Greek freedom, and only
received its final abolition, after more than eleven hundred years
of continuance, from the decree of the Christian emperor Theodosius
in 394 <small>A. D.</small> I have already recounted, in
the preceding volume of this history, the attempt made by Pheidon,
despot of Argos, to restore to the Pisatans, or to acquire for
himself, the administration of this festival,—an event which proves
the importance of the festival in Peloponnesus, even so early as
740 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> At that time, and for some
years afterwards, it seems to have been frequented chiefly, if not
exclusively, by the neighboring inhabitants of central and western
Peloponnesus,—Spartans, Messenians, Arkadians, Triphylians, Pisatans,
Eleians, and Achæans,<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107"
class="fnanchor">[107]</a>—and it forms an important link
connecting the Etolo-Eleians, and their privileges as Agonothets
to solemnize and preside over it, with Sparta. From the year 720
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, we trace positive evidences of the
gradual presence of more distant Greeks,—Corinthians, Megarians,
Bœotians, Athenians, and even Smyrnæans from Asia.</p>

<p>We observe also another proof of growing importance, in the
increased number and variety of matches exhibited to the spectators,
and in the substitution of the simple crown of olive, an honorary
reward, in place of the more substantial present which the Olympic
festival and all other Grecian festivals began by conferring
upon the victor. The humble constitution of the Olympic games
presented originally nothing more than a match of runners<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[p. 56]</span> in the measured course
called the Stadium: a continuous series of the victorious runners
was formally inscribed and preserved by the Eleians, beginning
with Korœbus in 776 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, and was made to
serve by chronological inquirers from the third century
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> downwards, as a means of measuring
the chronological sequence of Grecian events. It was on the occasion
of the 7th Olympiad after Korœbus, that Daiklês the Messenian first
received for his victory in the stadium no farther recompense than a
wreath from the sacred olive-tree near Olympia:<a id="FNanchor_108"
href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> the honor of being
proclaimed victor was found sufficient, without any pecuniary
addition. But until the 14th Olympiad, there was no other match
for the spectators to witness beside that of simple runners in the
stadium. On that occasion a second race was first introduced, of
runners in the double stadium, or up and down the course; in the
next, or 15th Olympiad (720 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), a third
match, the long course for runners, or several times up and down
the stadium. There were thus three races,—the simple stadium, the
double stadium, or diaulos, and the long course, or dolichos, all for
runners,—which continued without addition until the 18th Olympiad,
when the wrestling-match and the complicated pentathlon—including
jumping, running, the quoit, the javelin, and wrestling—were
both added. A farther novelty appears in the 23rd Olympiad (688
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), the boxing-match; and another, still more
important, in the 25th (680 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>),
the chariot with four full-grown horses. This last-mentioned addition
is deserving of special notice, not merely as it diversified
the scene by the introduction of horses, but also as it brought
in a totally new class of competitors,—rich men and women, who
possessed the finest horses and could hire the most skilful
drivers, without any personal superiority, or power of bodily
display, in themselves.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109"
class="fnanchor">[109]</a> The prodigious<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_57">[p. 57]</span> exhibition of wealth in which the
chariot proprietors indulged, is not only an evidence of growing
importance in the Olympic games, but also served materially to
increase that importance, and to heighten the interest of spectators.
Two farther matches were added in the 33rd Olympiad (648
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>),—the pankration, or boxing and
wrestling conjoined,<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110"
class="fnanchor">[110]</a> with the hand unarmed or divested of
that hard leather cestus<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111"
class="fnanchor">[111]</a> worn by the pugilist, which rendered the
blow of the latter more terrible, but at the same time prevented
him from grasping or keeping hold of his adversary,—and the single
race-horse. Many other novelties were introduced one after the other,
which it is unnecessary fully to enumerate,—the race between men
clothed in full panoply, and bearing each his shield,—the different
matches between boys, analogous to those between full-grown men,
and between colts, of the same nature as between full-grown horses.
At the maximum of its attraction the Olympic solemnity occupied
five days, but until the 77th Olympiad, all the various matches
had been compressed into one,—beginning at daybreak and not always
closing before dark.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112"
class="fnanchor">[112]</a> The 77th Olympiad follows immediately
after the success<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[p.
58]</span>ful expulsion of the Persian invaders from Greece, when
the Pan-Hellenic feeling had been keenly stimulated by resistance to
a common enemy; and we may easily conceive that this was a suitable
moment for imparting additional dignity to the chief national
festival.</p>

<p>We are thus enabled partially to trace the steps by which, during
the two centuries succeeding 776 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,
the festival of the Olympic Zeus in the Pisatid gradually passed
from a local to a national character, and acquired an attractive
force capable of bringing together into temporary union the dispersed
fragments of Hellas, from Marseilles to Trebizond. In this important
function it did not long stand alone. During the sixth century
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, three other festivals, at first
local, became successively nationalized,—the Pythia near Delphi, the
Isthmia, near Corinth, the Nemea near Kleônæ, between Sikyôn and
Argos.</p>

<p>In regard to the Pythian festival, we find a short notice of the
particular incidents and individuals by whom its reconstitution
and enlargement were brought about,—a notice the more interesting,
inasmuch as these very incidents are themselves a manifestation
of something like Pan-Hellenic patriotism, standing almost
alone in an age which presents little else in operation except
distinct city-interests. At the time when the Homeric Hymn to the
Delphinian Apollo was composed (probably in the seventh century
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), the Pythian festival had as yet
acquired little eminence. The rich and holy temple of Apollo was
then purely oracular, established for the purpose of communicating
to pious inquirers “the counsels of the immortals.” Multitudes of
visitors came to consult it, as well as to sacrifice victims and to
deposit costly offerings; but while the god delighted in the sound
of the harp as an accompaniment to the singing of pæans, he was
by no means anxious to encourage horse-races and chariot-races in
the neighborhood,—nay, this psalmist considers that the noise of
horses would be “a nuisance,” the drinking of mules a desecration
to the sacred fountains, and the ostentation of fine-built
chariots objectionable,<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113"
class="fnanchor">[113]</a> as tending to divert the attention of
spectators away from the great temple and its wealth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[p. 59]</span>From such
inconveniences the god was protected by placing his sanctuary
“in the rocky Pytho,”—a rugged and uneven recess, of no great
dimensions, embosomed in the southern declivity of Parnassus, and
about two thousand feet above the level of the sea, while the topmost
Parnassian summits reach a height of near eight thousand feet. The
situation was extremely imposing, but unsuited by nature for the
congregation of any considerable number of spectators,—altogether
impracticable for chariot-races,—and only rendered practicable by
later art and outlay for the theatre as well as for the stadium;
the original stadium, when first established, was placed in the
plain beneath. It furnished little means of subsistence, but the
sacrifices and presents of visitors enabled the ministers of the
temple to live in abundance,<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114"
class="fnanchor">[114]</a> and gathered together by degrees a village
around it. Near the sanctuary of Pytho, and about the same altitude,
was situated the ancient Phocian town of Krissa, on a projecting
spur of Parnassus,—overhung above by the line of rocky precipice
called the Phædriades, and itself overhanging below the deep ravine
through which flows the river Pleistus. On the other side of this
river rises the steep mountain Kirphis, which projects southward
into the Corinthian gulf,—the river reaching that gulf through the
broad Krissæan or Kirrhæan plain, which stretches westward nearly to
the Lokrian town of Amphissa; a plain for the most part fertile and
productive, though least so in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[p.
60]</span> its eastern part immediately under the Kirphis, where the
seaport Kirrha was placed.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115"
class="fnanchor">[115]</a> The temple, the oracle, and the wealth
of Pytho, belong to the very earliest periods of Grecian antiquity;
but the octennial solemnity in honor of the god included at first no
other competition except that of bards, who sang each a pæan with the
harp. It has been already mentioned, in my preceding volume, that the
Amphiktyonic assembly held one of its half-yearly meetings near the
temple of Pytho, the other at Thermopylæ.</p>

<p>In those early times when the Homeric Hymn to Apollo was composed,
the town of Krissa appears to have been great and powerful,
possessing all the broad plain between Parnassus, Kirphis, and
the gulf, to which latter it gave its name,—and possessing also,
what was a property not less valuable, the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_61">[p. 61]</span> adjoining sanctuary of Pytho itself,
which the Hymn identifies with Krissa, not indicating Delphi as a
separate place. The Krissæans, doubtless, derived great profits from
the number of visitors who came to visit Delphi, both by land and
by sea, and Kirrha was originally only the name for their seaport.
Gradually, however, the port appears to have grown in importance
at the expense of the town, just as Apollonia and Ptolemais came
to equal Kyrênê and Barka, and as Plymouth Dock has swelled into
Devonport; while at the same time, the sanctuary of Pytho with
its administrators expanded into the town of Delphi, and came to
claim an independent existence of its own. The original relations
between Krissa, Kirrha, and Delphi, were in this manner at length
subverted, the first declining and the two latter rising. The
Krissæans found themselves dispossessed of the management of the
temple, which passed to the Delphians, as well as of the profits
arising from the visitors, whose disbursements went to enrich
the inhabitants of Kirrha. Krissa was a primitive city of the
Phocian name, and could boast of a place as such in the Homeric
Catalogue, so that her loss of importance was not likely to be
quietly endured. Moreover, in addition to the above facts, already
sufficient in themselves as seeds of quarrel, we are told that the
Kirrhæans abused their position as masters of the avenue to the
temple by sea, and levied exorbitant tolls on the visitors who
landed there,—a number constantly increasing from the multiplication
of the transmarine colonies, and from the prosperity of those in
Italy and Sicily. Besides such offence against the general Grecian
public, they had also incurred the enmity of their Phocian neighbors
by outrages upon women, Phocian as well as Argeian, who were
returning from the temple.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116"
class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>Thus stood the case, apparently, about 595 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,
when the Amphiktyonic meeting
interfered—either prompted by the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_62">[p. 62]</span> Phocians, or perhaps on their own
spontaneous impulse, out of regard to the temple—to punish the
Kirrhæans. After a war of ten years, the first Sacred War in
Greece, this object was completely accomplished, by a joint force
of Thessalians under Eurylochus, Sikyonians under Kleisthenês,
and Athenians under Alkmæon; the Athenian Solon being the person
who originated and enforced, in the Amphiktyonic council, the
proposition of interference. Kirrha appears to have made a strenuous
resistance until its supplies from the sea were intercepted by the
naval force of the Sikyonian Kleisthenês; and even after the town
was taken, its inhabitants defended themselves for some time on
the heights of Kirphis.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117"
class="fnanchor">[117]</a> At length, however, they were thoroughly
subdued. Their town was destroyed, or left to subsist merely as
a landing-place; and the whole adjoining plain was consecrated
to the Delphian god, whose domains thus touched the sea. Under
this sentence, pronounced by the religious feeling of Greece, and
sanctified by a solemn oath publicly sworn and inscribed at Delphi,
the land was condemned to remain untilled and unplanted, without any
species of human care, and serving only for the pasturage of cattle.
The latter circumstance was convenient to the temple, inasmuch
as it furnished abundance of victims for the pilgrims who landed
and came to sacrifice,—for without preliminary sacrifice no man
could consult the oracle;<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118"
class="fnanchor">[118]</a> while the entire prohibition of tillage
was the only means of obviating the growth of another troublesome
neighbor on the sea-board. The fate of Kirrha in this war is
ascertained: that of Krissa is not so clear, nor do we know whether
it was destroyed, or left subsisting in a position of inferiority
with regard to Delphi. From this time forward, however, the Delphian
community appears as substantive and autonomous, exercising in
their own right the management of the temple; though we shall find,
on more than one occasion, that the Phocians contest this right,
and lay claim<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[p. 63]</span>
to the management of it for themselves,<a id="FNanchor_119"
href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>—a remnant of that
early period when the oracle stood in the domain of the Phocian
Krissa. There seems, moreover, to have been a standing antipathy
between the Delphians and the Phocians.</p>

<p>The Sacred War just mentioned, emanating from a solemn
Amphiktyonic decree, carried on jointly by troops of different states
whom we do not know to have ever before coöperated, and directed
exclusively towards an object of common interest, is in itself a fact
of high importance as manifesting a decided growth of Pan-Hellenic
feeling. Sparta is not named as interfering,—a circumstance which
seems remarkable when we consider both her power, even as it then
stood, and her intimate connection with the Delphian oracle,—while
the Athenians appear as the prime movers, through the greatest and
best of their citizens: the credit of a large-minded patriotism rests
prominently upon them.</p>

<p>But if this Sacred War itself is a proof that the Pan-Hellenic
spirit was growing stronger, the positive result in which it ended
reinforced that spirit still farther. The spoils of Kirrha were
employed by the victorious allies in founding the Pythian games.
The octennial festival hitherto celebrated at Delphi in honor of
the god, including no other competition except in the harp and the
pæan, was expanded into comprehensive games on the model of the
Olympic, with matches not only of music, but also of gymnastics and
chariots,—celebrated, not at Delphi itself, but on the maritime
plain near the ruined Kirrha,—and under the direct superintendence
of the Amphiktyons themselves. I have already mentioned that Solon
provided large rewards for such Athenians as gained victories in
the Olympic and Isthmian games, thereby indicating his sense of the
great value of the national games as a means of promoting Hellenic
intercommunion. It was the same feeling which instigated the
foundation of the new games on the Kirrhæan plain, in commemoration
of the vindicated honor of Apollo, and in the territory newly made
over to him. They were celebrated in the latter half of summer,
or first half of every third Olympic year,—the Amphiktyons being
the ostensible agonothets, or administrators, and appointing
persons to discharge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[p.
64]</span> the duty in their names.<a id="FNanchor_120"
href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> At the first Pythian
ceremony (in 586 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), valuable rewards
were given to the different victors; at the second (582
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), nothing was conferred but wreaths
of laurel,—the rapidly attained celebrity of the games being such
as to render any farther reward superfluous. The Sikyonian despot
Kleisthenês himself, one of the leaders in the conquest of Kirrha,
gained the prize at the chariot-race of the second Pythia. We find
other great personages in Greece frequently mentioned as competitors,
and the games long maintained a dignity second only to the Olympic,
over which, indeed, they had some advantages; first, that they
were not abused for the purpose of promoting petty jealousies and
antipathies of any administering state, as the Olympic games were
perverted by the Eleians, on more than one occasion; next, that
they comprised music and poetry as well as bodily display. From
the circumstances attending their foundation, the Pythian games
deserved, even more than the Olympic, the title bestowed on them by
Demosthenês,—“The common Agôn of the Greeks.”<a id="FNanchor_121"
href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[p. 65]</span>The Olympic
and Pythian games continued always to be the most venerated
solemnities in Greece: yet the Nemea and Isthmia acquired a
celebrity not much inferior; the Olympic prize counting for
the highest of all.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122"
class="fnanchor">[122]</a> Both the Nemea and the Isthmia were
distinguished from the other two festivals by occurring, not once
in four years, but once in two years; the former in the second
and fourth years of each Olympiad, the latter in the first and
third years. To both is assigned, according to Greek custom, an
origin connected with the interesting persons and circumstances
of Grecian antiquity: but our historical knowledge of both begins
with the sixth century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> The
first historical Nemead is presented as belonging to Olympiad 52
or 53 (572-568 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), a few years
subsequent to the Sacred War above mentioned and to the origin of
the Pythia. The festival was celebrated in honor of the Nemean
Zeus, in the valley of Nemea, between Phlius and Kleônæ,—and
originally by the Kleônæans themselves, until, at some period after
460 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, the Argeians deprived them of that
honor and assumed the honors of administration to themselves.<a
id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
The Nemean games had their Hellanodikæ<a id="FNanchor_124"
href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> to superintend,
to keep order, and to distribute the prizes, as well as the
Olympic. Respecting the Isthmian festival, our first historical
information is a little earlier, for it has already been
stated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[p. 66]</span> that
Solon conferred a premium upon every Athenian citizen who gained
a prize at that festival as well as at the Olympian,—in or after
594 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> It was celebrated by the
Corinthians at their isthmus, in honor of Poseidôn; and if we may
draw any inference from the legends respecting its foundation,
which is ascribed sometimes to Theseus, the Athenians appear to
have identified it with the antiquities of their own state.<a
id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[p. 67]</span>We thus
perceive that the interval between 600-560 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>
exhibits the first historical manifestation of the Pythia, Isthmia,
and Nemea,—the first expansion of all the three from local into
Pan-Hellenic festivals. To the Olympic games, for some time the only
great centre of union among all the widely dispersed Greeks, are now
added three other sacred agônes of the like public, open, national
character; constituting visible marks, as well as tutelary bonds,
of collective Hellenism, and insuring to every Greek who went to
compete in the matches, a safe and inviolate transit even through
hostile Hellenic states.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126"
class="fnanchor">[126]</a> These four, all in or near Peloponnesus,
and one of which occurred in each year, formed the period, or
cycle, of sacred games, and those who had gained prizes at all
the four received the enviable designation of periodonikes:<a
id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
the honors paid to Olympic victors on their return to their
native city were prodigious, even in the sixth century
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, and became even more extravagant
afterwards. We may remark that in the Olympic games alone, the
oldest as well as the most illustrious of the four, the musical
and intellectual element was wanting: all the three more recent
agônes included crowns for exercises of music and poetry, along with
gymnastics, chariots, and horses.</p>

<p>Nor was it only in the distinguishing national stamp set upon
these four great festivals that the gradual increase of Hellenic
family-feeling exhibited itself, during the course of this earliest
period of our history. Pursuant to the same tendencies, religious
festivals in all the considerable towns gradually became more and
more open and accessible, and attracted guests as well as<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[p. 68]</span> competitors from beyond
the border; the dignity of the state, as well as the honor rendered
to the presiding god, being measured by numbers, admiration,
and envy, in the frequenting visitors.<a id="FNanchor_128"
href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> There is no positive
evidence, indeed, of such expansion in the Attic festivals earlier
than the reign of Peisistratus, who first added the quadrennial or
greater Panathenæa to the ancient annual or lesser Panathenæa; nor
can we trace the steps of progress in regard to Thebes, Orchomenus,
Thespiæ, Megara, Sikyôn, Pellênê, Ægina, Argos, etc., but we find
full reason for believing that such was the general reality. Of the
Olympic or Isthmian victors whom Pindar and Simonidês celebrated,
many derived a portion of their renown from previous victories
acquired at several of these local contests,<a id="FNanchor_129"
href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>—victories sometimes
so numerous, as to prove how wide-spread the habit of mutual
frequentation had become;<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130"
class="fnanchor">[130]</a> though we find, even in the third century
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, treaties of alliance between
different cities, in which it is thought necessary to confer this
mutual right by express stipulation. Temptation was offered, to the
distinguished gymnastic or musical competitors, by prizes of great
value; and Timæus even asserted, as a proof of the overweening pride
of Kroton and Sybaris, that these cities tried to supplant the
preëminence of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[p. 69]</span>
Olympic games, by instituting games of their own with the richest
prizes, to be celebrated at the same time,<a id="FNanchor_131"
href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>—a statement in itself
not worthy of credit, but nevertheless illustrating the animated
rivalry known to prevail among the Grecian cities in procuring for
themselves splendid and crowded games. At the time when the Homeric
Hymn to Dêmêtêr was composed, the worship of that goddess seems to
have been purely local at Eleusis; but before the Persian war, the
festival celebrated by the Athenians every year, in honor of the
Eleusinian Dêmêtêr, admitted Greeks of all cities to be initiated,
and was attended by vast crowds of them.<a id="FNanchor_132"
href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

<p>It was thus that the simplicity and strict local application
of the primitive religious festival, among the greater states in
Greece, gradually expanded, on certain great occasions periodically
recurring, into an elaborate and regulated series of exhibitions,—not
merely admitting, but soliciting the fraternal presence of all
Hellenic spectators. In this respect Sparta seems to have formed
an exception to the remaining states: her festivals were for
herself alone, and her general rudeness towards other Greeks was
not materially softened even at the Karneia,<a id="FNanchor_133"
href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> or Hyakinthia, or
Gymnopædiæ. On the other hand, the Attic Dionysia were gradually
exalted, from their original rude spontaneous outburst of
village<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[p. 70]</span> feeling
in thankfulness to the god, followed by song, dance, and revelry
of various kinds,—into costly and diversified performances,
first, by a trained chorus, next, by actors superadded to it;<a
id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
and the dramatic compositions thus produced, as they embodied
the perfection of Grecian art, so they were eminently calculated
to invite a Pan-Hellenic audience and to encourage the sentiment
of Hellenic unity. The dramatic literature of Athens, however,
belongs properly to a later period; previous to the year 560
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, we see only those commencements
of innovation which drew upon Thespis<a id="FNanchor_135"
href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> the rebuke of Solon,
who himself contributed to impart to the Panathenaic festival a more
solemn and attractive character, by checking the license of the
rhapsodes, and insuring to those present a full, orderly recital of
the Iliad.</p>

<p>The sacred games and festivals, here alluded to as a class,
took hold of the Greek mind by so great a variety of feelings,<a
id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
as to counterbalance in a high degree the political disseverance,
and to keep alive among their wide-spread cities, in the midst of
constant jealousy and frequent quarrel, a feeling of brotherhood
and congenial sentiment such as must otherwise have died away.
The Theôrs, or sacred envoys, who came to Olympia or Delphi from
so many different points, all sacrificed to the same god and at
the same altar, witnessed the same sports, and contributed by
their donatives to enrich or adorn one respected scene. Nor must
we forget that the festival afforded opportunity for a sort<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[p. 71]</span> of fair, including much
traffic amid so large a mass of spectators,<a id="FNanchor_137"
href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> and besides the
exhibitions of the games themselves, there were recitations and
lectures in a spacious council-room for those who chose to listen
to them, by poets, rhapsodes, philosophers, and historians,—among
which last, the history of Herodotus is said to have been publicly
read by its author.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138"
class="fnanchor">[138]</a> Of the wealthy and great men in the
various cities, many contended simply for the chariot victories
and horse victories. But there were others whose ambition was
of a character more strictly personal, and who stripped naked
as runners, wrestlers, boxers, or pankratiasts, having gone
through the extreme fatigue of a complete previous training.
Kylon, whose unfortunate attempt to usurp the sceptre at Athens
has been recounted, had gained the prize in the Olympic stadium:
Alexander son of Amyntas, the prince of Macedon, had run for it.<a
id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a>
The great family of the Diagoridæ at Rhodes,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_72">[p. 72]</span> who furnished magistrates and generals
to their native city, supplied a still greater number of successful
boxers and pankratiasts at Olympia, while other instances also occur
of generals named by various cities from the lists of successful
Olympic gymnasts; and the odes of Pindar, always dearly purchased,
attest how many of the great and wealthy were found in that list.<a
id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
The perfect popularity and equality of persons at these great
games, is a feature not less remarkable than the exact adherence to
predetermined rule, and the self-imposed submission of the immense
crowd to a handful of servants armed with sticks,<a id="FNanchor_141"
href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> who executed the
orders of the Eleian Hellanodikæ. The ground upon which the ceremony
took place, and even the territory of the administering state, was
protected by a “Truce of God,” during the month of the festival,
the commencement of which was formally announced by heralds sent
round to the different states. Treaties of peace between different
cities were often formally commemorated by pillars there erected,
and the general impression of the scene suggested nothing but
ideas of peace and brotherhood among Greeks.<a id="FNanchor_142"
href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> And I may<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[p. 73]</span> remark that the
impression of the games as belonging to all Greeks, and to none but
Greeks, was stronger and clearer during the interval between 600-300
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, than it came to be afterwards.
For the Macedonian conquests had the effect of diluting and
corrupting Hellenism, by spreading an exterior varnish of Hellenic
tastes and manners over a wide area of incongruous foreigners, who
were incapable of the real elevation of the Hellenic character; so
that although in later times the games continued undiminished, both
in attraction and in number of visitors, the spirit of Pan-Hellenic
communion, which had once animated the scene, was gone forever.</p>

  <h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIX.<br />
    LYRIC POETRY. — THE SEVEN WISE MEN.</h2>
</div>

<p class="mt1"><span class="smcap">The</span> interval between
776-560 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> presents to us a remarkable
expansion of Grecian genius in the creation of their elegiac,
iambic, lyric, choric, and gnomic poetry, which was diversified
in a great many ways and improved by many separate masters. The
creators of all these different styles—from Kallinus and Archilochus
down to Stesichorus—fall within the two centuries here included;
though Pindar and Simonidês, “the proud and high-crested bards,”<a
id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
who carried lyric and choric poetry to the maximum of elaboration
consistent with full poetical effect, lived in the succeeding
century, and were contemporary with the tragedian Æschylus. The
Grecian drama, comic as well as tragic, of the fifth century
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, combined the lyric and choric song<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[p. 74]</span> with the living action of
iambic dialogue,—thus constituting the last ascending movement in the
poetical genius of the race. Reserving this for a future time, and
for the history of Athens, to which it more particularly belongs, I
now propose to speak only of the poetical movement of the two earlier
centuries, wherein Athens had little or no part. So scanty are the
remnants, unfortunately, of these earlier poets, that we can offer
little except criticisms borrowed at second-hand, and a few general
considerations on their workings and tendency.<a id="FNanchor_144"
href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<p>Archilochus and Kallinus both appear to fall about the middle of
the seventh century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, and it is with
them that the innovations in Grecian poetry commence. Before them, we
are told, there existed nothing but the epos, or daktylic hexameter
poetry, of which much has been said in my former volume,—being
legendary stories or adventures narrated, together with addresses or
hymns to the gods. We must recollect, too, that this was not only the
whole poetry, but the whole literature of the age: prose composition
was altogether unknown, and writing, if beginning to be employed as
an aid to a few superior men, was at any rate generally unused, and
found no reading public. The voice was the only communicant, and
the ear the only recipient, of all those ideas and feelings which
productive minds in the community found themselves impelled to pour
out; both voice and ear being accustomed to a musical recitation,
or chant, apparently something between song and speech, with simple
rhythm and a still simpler occasional accompaniment from the
primitive four-stringed harp. Such habits and requirements of the
voice and ear were, at that time, inseparably associated with the
success and popularity of the poet, and contributed doubtless to
restrict the range of subjects with which he could deal. The<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[p. 75]</span> type was to a certain
extent consecrated, like the primitive statues of the gods, from
which men only ventured to deviate by gradual and almost unconscious
innovations. Moreover, in the first half of the seventh century
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, that genius which had once created
an Iliad and an Odyssey was no longer to be found, and the work
of hexameter narrative had come to be prosecuted by less gifted
persons,—by those Cyclic poets of whom I have spoken in the preceding
volumes.</p>

<p>Such, as far as we can make it out amidst very uncertain evidence,
was the state of the Greek mind immediately before elegiac and lyric
poets appeared; while at the same time its experience was enlarging
by the formation of new colonies, and the communion among its various
states tended to increase by the freer reciprocity of religious games
and festivals. There arose a demand for turning the literature of the
age—I use this word as synonymous with the poetry—to new feelings and
purposes, and for applying the rich, plastic, and musical language of
the old epic, to present passion and circumstance, social as well as
individual. Such a tendency had become obvious in Hesiod, even within
the range of hexameter verse; but the same causes which led to an
enlargement of the subjects of poetry inclined men also to vary the
metre.</p>

<p>In regard to this latter point, there is reason to believe that
the expansion of Greek music was the immediate determining cause; for
it has been already stated that the musical scale and instruments
of the Greeks, originally very narrow, were materially enlarged
by borrowing from Phrygia and Lydia, and these acquisitions seem
to have been first realized about the beginning of the seventh
century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, through the Lesbian harper
Terpander,—the Phrygian (or Greco-Phrygian) flute-player Olympus,—and
the Arkadian or Bœotian flute-player Klonas. Terpander made the
important advance of exchanging the original four-stringed harp for
one of seven strings, embracing the compass of one octave or two
Greek tetrachords, and Olympus as well as Klonas taught many new
nomes, or tunes, on the flute, to which the Greeks had before been
strangers,—probably also the use of a flute of more varied musical
compass. Terpander is said to have gained the prize at the first
recorded celebration of the Lacedæmonian festival of the Karneia,
in 676<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[p. 76]</span>
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>: this is one of the best-ascertained
points among the obscure chronology of the seventh century; and there
seem grounds for assigning Olympus and Klonas to nearly the same
period, a little before Archilochus and Kallinus.<a id="FNanchor_145"
href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> To Terpander,
Olympus, and Klonas, are ascribed the formation of the earliest
musical nomes known to the inquiring Greeks of later times: to the
first, nomes on the harp; to the two latter, on the flute,—every
nome being the general scheme, or basis, of which the airs actually
performed constituted so many variations, within certain<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[p. 77]</span> defined limits.<a
id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
Terpander employed his enlarged instrumental power as a new
accompaniment to the Homeric poems, as well as to certain epic
proœmia or hymns to the gods of his own composition. But he does
not seem to have departed from the hexameter verse and the daktylic
rhythm, to which the new accompaniment was probably not quite
suitable; and the idea may thus have been suggested of combining the
words also according to new rhythmical and metrical laws.</p>

<p>It is certain, at least, that the age (670-600) immediately
succeeding Terpander,—comprising Archilochus, Kallinus, Tyrtæus, and
Alkman, whose relations of time one to another we have no certain
means of determining,<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147"
class="fnanchor">[147]</a> though Alkman seems to have been the
latest,—presents a remarkable variety both of new metres and of
new rhythms, superinduced upon the previ<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_78">[p. 78]</span>ous daktylic hexameter. The first
departure from this latter is found in the elegiac verse, employed
seemingly more or less by all the four above-mentioned poets,
but chiefly by the first two, and even ascribed by some to the
invention of Kallinus. Tyrtæus in his military march-songs employed
the anapæstic metre, but in Archilochus as well as in Alkman we
find traces of a much larger range of metrical variety,—iambic,
trochaic, anapæstic, ionic, etc.,—sometimes even asynartetic or
compound metres, anapæstic or daktylic, blended with trochaic or
iambic. What we have remaining from Mimnermus, who comes about the
close of the preceding four, is elegiac; his contemporaries Alkæus
and Sappho, besides employing most of those metres which they found
existing, invented each a peculiar stanza of their own, which is
familiarly known under a name derived from each. In Solon, the
younger contemporary of Mimnermus, we have the elegiac, iambic, and
trochaic: in Theognis, yet later, the elegiac only. But both Arion
and Stesichorus appear to have been innovators in this department,
the former by his improvement in the dithyrambic chorus or circular
song and dance in honor of Dionysus,—the latter by his more elaborate
choric compositions, containing not only a strophê and antistrophê,
but also a third division or epode succeeding them, pronounced by the
chorus standing still. Both Anakreon and Ibykus likewise added to the
stock of existing metrical varieties. And we thus see that, within
the century and a half succeeding Terpander, Greek poetry (or Greek
literature, which was then the same thing) became greatly enriched in
matter as well as diversified in form.</p>

<p>To a certain extent there seems to have been a real connection
between the two: new forms were essential for the expression of
new wants and feelings,—though the assertion that elegiac metre is
especially adapted for one set of feelings,<a id="FNanchor_148"
href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> trochaic for<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[p. 79]</span> a second, and iambic for
a third, if true at all, can only be admitted with great latitude of
exception, when we find so many of them employed by the poets for
very different subjects,—gay or melancholy, bitter or complaining,
earnest or sprightly,—seemingly with little discrimination.</p>

<p>But the adoption of some new metre, different from the perpetual
series of hexameters, was required when the poet desired to do
something more than recount a long story or fragment of heroic
legend,—when he sought to bring himself, his friends, his enemies,
his city, his hopes and fears with regard to matters recent or
impending, all before the notice of the hearer, and that, too, at
once with brevity and animation. The Greek hexameter, like our blank
verse, has all its limiting conditions bearing upon each separate
line, and presents to the hearer no predetermined resting-place
or natural pause beyond.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149"
class="fnanchor">[149]</a> In reference to any long composition,
either epic or dramatic, such unrestrained license is found
convenient, and the case was similar for Greek epos and drama,—the
single-lined iambic trimeter being generally used for the dialogue
of tragedy and comedy, just as the daktylic hexameter had been
used for the epic. The metrical changes introduced by Archilochus
and his contemporaries may be compared to a change from our blank
verse to the rhymed couplet and quatrain: the verse was thrown into
little systems of two, three, or four lines, with a pause at the
end of each; and the halt thus assured to, as well as expected and
relished by, the ear, was generally coincident with a close, entire
or partial,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[p. 80]</span> in
the sense, which thus came to be distributed with greater point and
effect. The elegiac verse, or common hexameter and pentameter (this
second line being an hexameter with the third and sixth thesis,<a
id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
or the last half of the third and sixth foot, suppressed, and a
pause left in place of it), as well as the epode (or iambic trimeter
followed by an iambic dimeter) and some other binary combinations
of verse which we trace among the fragments of Archilochus, are
conceived with a view to such increase of effect both on the ear
and the mind, not less than to the direct pleasures of novelty and
variety.</p>

<p>The iambic metre, built upon the primitive iambus, or coarse
and licentious jesting,<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151"
class="fnanchor">[151]</a> which formed a part of some Grecian<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[p. 81]</span> festivals (especially
of the festivals of Dêmêtêr as well in Attica as in Paros, the
native country of the poet), is only one amongst many new paths
struck out by his inventive genius; whose exuberance astonishes
us, when we consider that he takes his start from little more than
the simple hexameter,<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152"
class="fnanchor">[152]</a> in which, too, he was a distinguished
composer,—for even of the elegiac verse he is as likely to have been
the inventor as Kallinus, just as he was the earliest popular and
successful composer of table-songs, or Skolia, though Terpander may
have originated some such before him. The entire loss of his poems,
excepting some few fragments, enables us to recognize little more
than one characteristic,—the intense personality which pervaded
them, as well as that coarse, direct, and out-spoken license,
which afterwards lent such terrible effect to the old comedy at
Athens. His lampoons are said to have driven Lykambês, the father
of Neobulê, to hang himself: the latter had been promised to
Archilochus in marriage, but that promise was broken, and the poet
assailed both father and daughter with every species of calumny.<a
id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a>
In addition to this disappointment, he was poor, the son of
a slave-mother, and an exile from his country, Paros, to the
unpromising colony of Thasos. The desultory notices respecting
him betray a state of suffering combined with loose conduct which
vented itself sometimes in complaint, sometimes in libellous
assault; and he was at last slain by some whom his muse had thus
exasperated. His extraordinary poetical genius finds but one voice
of encomium throughout antiquity. His triumphal song to Hêra<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[p. 82]</span>klês was still popularly
sung by the victors at Olympia, near two centuries after his death,
in the days of Pindar; but that majestic and complimentary poet at
once denounces the malignity, and attests the retributive suffering,
of the great Parian iambist.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154"
class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

<p>Amidst the multifarious veins in which Archilochus displayed
his genius, moralizing or gnomic poetry is not wanting, while
his contemporary Simonides, of Amorgos, devotes the iambic metre
especially to this destination, afterwards followed out by Solon
and Theognis. But Kallinus, the earliest celebrated elegiac poet,
so far as we can judge from his few fragments, employed the elegiac
metre for exhortations of warlike patriotism; and the more ample
remains which we possess of Tyrtæus are sermons in the same strain,
preaching to the Spartans bravery against the foe, and unanimity as
well as obedience to the law at home. They are patriotic effusions,
called forth by the circumstances of the time, and sung by single
voice, with accompaniment of the flute,<a id="FNanchor_155"
href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> to those in whose
bosoms the flame of courage was to be kindled. For though what we
peruse is in verse, we are still in the tide of real and present
life, and we must suppose ourselves rather listening to an orator
addressing the citizens when danger or dissension is actually
impending. It is only in the hands of Mimnermus that elegiac verse
comes to be devoted to soft and amatory subjects. His few fragments
present a vein of passive and tender sentiment, illustrated by
appropriate matter of legend, such as would be cast into poetry in
all ages, and quite different from the rhetoric of Kallinus and
Tyrtæus.</p>

<p>The poetical career of Alkman is again distinct from that of
any of his above-mentioned contemporaries. Their compositions,
besides hymns to the gods, were principally expressions of feeling
intended to be sung by individuals, though sometimes also suited
for the kômus, or band of festive volunteers, assembled on some
occasion of common interest: those of Alkman were principally
choric, intended for the song and accompanying dance of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[p. 83]</span> the chorus. He was
a native of Sardis in Lydia, or at least his family were so;
and he appears to have come in early life to Sparta, though his
genius and mastery of the Greek language discountenance the story
that he was brought over to Sparta as a slave. The most ancient
arrangement of music at Sparta, generally ascribed to Terpander,<a
id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
underwent considerable alteration, not only through the elegiac and
anapæstic measures of Tyrtæus, but also through the Kretan Thalêtas
and the Lydian Alkman. The harp, the instrument of Terpander, was
rivalled and in part superseded by the flute or pipe, which had been
recently rendered more effective in the hands of Olympus, Klonas, and
Polymnêstus, and which gradually became, for compositions intended
to raise strong emotion, the favorite instrument of the two,—being
employed as accompaniment both to the elegies of Tyrtæus, and to the
hyporchemata (songs, or hymns, combined with dancing) of Thalêtas;
also, as the stimulus and regulator to the Spartan military march.<a
id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p>These elegies (as has been just remarked) were sung by one
person, in the midst of an assembly of listeners, and there were
doubtless other compositions intended for the individual voice.
But in general such was not the character of music and poetry at
Sparta; everything done there, both serious and recreative, was
public and collective, so that the chorus and its performances
received extraordinary development. It has been already stated,
that the chorus usually, with song and dance combined, constituted
an important part of divine service throughout all Greece, and
was originally a public manifestation of the citizens gener<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[p. 84]</span>ally,—a large proportion
of them being actively engaged in it,<a id="FNanchor_158"
href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> and receiving some
training for the purpose as an ordinary branch of education. Neither
the song nor the dance, under such conditions, could be otherwise
than extremely simple. But in process of time, the performance at the
chief festivals tended to become more elaborate, and to fall into
the hands of persons expressly and professionally trained,—the mass
of the citizens gradually ceasing to take active part, and being
present merely as spectators. Such was the practice which grew up in
most parts of Greece, and especially at Athens, where the dramatic
chorus acquired its highest perfection. But the drama never found
admission at Sparta, and the peculiarity of Spartan life tended much
to keep up the popular chorus on its ancient footing. It formed, in
fact, one element in that never-ceasing drill to which the Spartans
were subject from their boyhood, and it served a purpose analogous
to their military training, in accustoming them to simultaneous
and regulated movement,—insomuch that the comparison between the
chorus, especially in its Pyrrhic, or war-dances, and the military
enomoty, seems to have been often dwelt upon.<a id="FNanchor_159"
href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> In the singing of the
solemn pæan in honor of Apollo, at the festival of the Hyakinthia,
king Agesilaus was under the orders of the chorus-master, and sang in
the place allotted to him;<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160"
class="fnanchor">[160]</a> while the whole body of Spartans without
exception,—the old,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[p. 85]</span>
the middle-aged, and the youth, the matrons, and the virgins,—were
distributed in various choric companies,<a id="FNanchor_161"
href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> and trained to
harmony both of voice and motion, which was publicly exhibited at the
solemnities of the Gymnopædiæ. The word <i>dancing</i> must be understood
in a larger sense than that in which it is now employed, and as
comprising every variety of rhythmical, accentuated, conspiring
movements, or gesticulations, or postures of the body, from the
slowest to the quickest;<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162"
class="fnanchor">[162]</a> cheironomy, or the decorous and expressive
movement of the hands, being especially practised.</p>

<p>We see thus that both at Sparta and in Krête (which approached
in respect to publicity of individual life most nearly to Sparta),
the choric aptitudes and manifestations occupied a larger space
than in any other Grecian city. And as a certain degree of
musical and rhythmical variety was essential to meet this want,<a
id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
while music was never taught to Spartan citizens individually,—we
farther understand how strangers like Terpander, Polymnêstus,
Thalêtas, Tyrtæus, Alkman, etc., were not only received, but acquired
great influence at Sparta, in spite of the preponderant spirit
of jealous seclusion in the Spartan character. All these masters
appear to have been effective in their own special vocation,—the
training of the chorus,—to which they imparted new rhythmical
action, and for which they composed new music. But Alkman did
this, and something more; he possessed the genius of a poet,
and his compositions were read afterwards<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_86">[p. 86]</span> with pleasure by those who could not
hear them sung or see them danced. In the little of his poems which
remains, we recognize that variety of rhythm and metre for which
he was celebrated. In this respect he (together with the Kretan
Thalêtas, who is said to have introduced a more vehement style both
of music and dance, with the Kretic and Pæonic rhythm, into Sparta<a
id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>)
surpassed Archilochus, and prepared the way for the complicated
choric movements of Stesichorus and Pindar: some of the fragments,
too, manifest that fresh outpouring of individual sentiment and
emotion which constitutes so much of the charm of popular poetry.
Besides his touching address in old age to the Spartan virgins,
over whose song and dance he had been accustomed to preside.—he is
not afraid to speak of his hearty appetite, satisfied with simple
food and relishing a bowl of warm broth at the winter tropic.<a
id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
And he has attached to the spring an epithet, which comes home to
the real feelings of a poor country more than those captivating
pictures which abound in verse, ancient as well as modern: he calls
it “the season of short fare,”—the crop of the previous year being
then nearly consumed, the husbandman is compelled to pinch himself
until his new harvest comes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[p.
87]</span> in.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166"
class="fnanchor">[166]</a> Those who recollect that in earlier
periods of our history, and in all countries where there is little
accumulated stock, an exorbitant difference is often experienced in
the price of corn before and after the harvest, will feel the justice
of Alkman’s description.</p>

<p>Judging from these and from a few other fragments of this
poet, Alkman appears to have combined the life and exciting vigor
of Archilochus in the song properly so called, sung by himself
individually,—with a larger knowledge of musical and rhythmical
effect in regard to the choric performance. He composed in the
Laconian dialect,—a variety of the Doric with some intermixture of
Æolisms. And it was from him, jointly with those other composers
who figured at Sparta during the century after Terpander, as
well as from the simultaneous development of the choric muse<a
id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
in Argos, Sikyôn, Arcadia, and other parts of Peloponnesus, that
the Doric dialect acquired permanent footing in Greece, as the only
proper dialect for choric compositions. Continued by Stesichorus
and Pindar, this habit passed even to the Attic dramatists, whose
choric songs are thus in a great measure Doric, while their dialogue
is Attic. At Sparta, as well as in other parts of Peloponnesus,<a
id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> the
musical and rhythmical style appears to have been fixed by Alkman
and his contemporaries, and to have been tenaciously maintained,
for two or three centuries, with little or no innovation; the more
so, as the flute-players at Sparta formed an hereditary profession,
who followed the routine of their fathers.<a id="FNanchor_169"
href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[p. 88]</span>Alkman was
the last poet who addressed himself to the popular chorus. Both
Arion and Stesichorus composed for a body of trained men, with a
degree of variety and involution such as could not be attained by a
mere fraction of the people. The primitive dithyrambus was a round
choric dance and song in honor of Dionysus,<a id="FNanchor_170"
href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> common to Naxos,
Thebes, and seemingly to many other places, at the Dionysiac
festival,—a spontaneous effusion of drunken men in the hour of
revelry, wherein the poet Archilochus, “with the thunder of wine full
upon his mind,” had often taken the chief part.<a id="FNanchor_171"
href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> Its exciting
character approached to the worship of the Great Mother in Asia,
and stood in contrast with the solemn and stately pæan addressed to
Apollo. Arion introduced into it an alteration such as Archilochus
had himself brought about in the scurrilous iambus. He converted
it into an elaborate composition in honor of the god, sung and
danced by a chorus of fifty persons, not only sober, but trained
with great strictness; though its rhythm and movements, and its
equipment in the character of satyrs, presented more or less an
imitation of the primitive license. Born at Methymna in Lesbos,
Arion appears as a harper, singer, and composer, much favored by
Periander at Corinth, in which city he first “composed, denominated,
and taught the dithyramb,” earlier than any one known to Herodotus.<a
id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
He did not, however, remain permanently there, but travelled from
city to city, exhibiting at the festivals for money,—especially
to Sicilian and Italian Greece, where he acquired large gains.
We may here again remark how the poets as well as the festivals
served to promote a sentiment of unity among the dispersed
Greeks. Such transfer of the dithyramb, from the field<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[p. 89]</span> of spontaneous nature
into the garden of art,<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173"
class="fnanchor">[173]</a> constitutes the first stage in the
refinement of Dionysiac worship; which will hereafter be found still
farther exalted in the form of the Attic drama.</p>

<p>The date of Arion seems about 600 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,
shortly after Alkman: that of Stesichorus is a few years later. To
the latter the Greek chorus owed a high degree of improvement, and
in particular the last finished distribution of its performance into
the strophê, the antistrophê, and the epôdus: the turn, the return,
and the rest,—the rhythm and metre of the song during each strophê
corresponded with that during the antistrophê, but was varied during
the epôdus, and again varied during the following strophês. Until
this time the song had been monostrophic, consisting of nothing
more than one uniform stanza, repeated from the beginning to the
end of the composition;<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174"
class="fnanchor">[174]</a> so that we may easily see how vast was
the new complication and difficulty introduced by Stesichorus,—not
less for the performers than for the composer, himself at that
time the teacher and trainer of performers. Both this poet and his
contemporary the flute-player Sakadas of Argos,—who gained the prize
at the first three Pythian games founded after the Sacred War,—seem
to have surpassed their predecessors in the breadth of subject
which they embraced, borrowing from the inexhaustible province of
ancient legend, and expanding the choric song into a well-sustained
epical narrative.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175"
class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Indeed, these Pythian games opened a
new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[p. 90]</span> career to
musical composers just at the time when Sparta began to be closed
against musical novelties.</p>

<p>Alkæus and Sappho, both natives of Lesbos, appear about
contemporaries with Arion, <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 610-580.
Of their once celebrated lyric compositions, scarcely anything
remains. But the criticisms which are preserved on both of them place
them in strong contrast with Alkman, who lived and composed under the
more restrictive atmosphere of Sparta,—and in considerable analogy
with the turbulent vehemence of Archilochus,<a id="FNanchor_176"
href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> though without
his intense private malignity. Both composed for their own local
audience, and in their own Lesbian Æolic dialect; not because there
was any peculiar fitness in that dialect to express their vein
of sentiment, but because it was more familiar to their hearers.
Sappho herself boasts of the preëminence of the Lesbian bards;<a
id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>
and the celebrity of Terpander, Perikleitas, and Arion, permits us
to suppose that there may have been before her many popular bards
in the island who did not attain to Hellenic celebrity. Alkæus
included in his songs the fiercest bursts of political feeling,
the stirring alternations of war and exile, and all the ardent
relish of a susceptible man for wine and love.<a id="FNanchor_178"
href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> The love-song seems
to have formed the principal theme of Sappho, who, however, also
composed odes or songs<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179"
class="fnanchor">[179]</a> on a great vari<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_91">[p. 91]</span>ety of other subjects, serious as well as
satirical, and is said farther to have first employed the Mixolydian
mode in music. It displays the tendency of the age to metrical and
rhythmical novelty, that Alkæus and Sappho are said to have each
invented the peculiar stanza, well-known under their respective
names,—combinations of the dactyl, trochee, and iambus, analogous
to the asynartetic verses of Archilochus; they by no means confined
themselves, however, to Alkaic and Sapphic metre. Both the one
and the other composed hymns to the gods; indeed, this is a theme
common to all the lyric and choric poets, whatever may be their
peculiarities in other ways. Most of their compositions were songs
for the single voice, not for the chorus. The poetry of Alkæus is the
more worthy of note, as it is the earliest instance of the employment
of the Muse in actual political warfare, and shows the increased hold
which that motive was acquiring on the Grecian mind.</p>

<p>The gnomic poets, or moralists in verse, approach by the tone
of their sentiments more to the nature of prose. They begin with
Simonidês of Amorgos or of Samos, the contemporary of Archilochus:
indeed, the latter himself devoted some compositions to the
illustrative fable, which had not been unknown even to Hesiod.
In the remains of Simonidês of Amorgos we trace nothing relative
to the man personally, though he too, like Archilochus, is said
to have had an individual enemy, Orodœkidês, whose character was
aspersed by his muse.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180"
class="fnanchor">[180]</a> His only<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_92">[p. 92]</span> considerable poem extant is devoted to
a survey of the characters of women, in iambic verse, and by way
of comparison with various animals,—the mare, the ass, the bee,
etc. It follows out the Hesiodic vein respecting the social and
economical mischief usually caused by women, with some few honorable
exceptions; but the poet shows a much larger range of observation
and illustration, if we compare him with his predecessor Hesiod;
moreover, his illustrations come fresh from life and reality. We find
in this early iambist the same sympathy with industry and its due
rewards which are observable in Hesiod, together with a still more
melancholy sense of the uncertainty of human events.</p>

<p>Of Solon and Theognis I have spoken in former chapters. They
reproduce in part the moralizing vein of Simonidês, though with
a strong admixture of personal feeling and a direct application
to passing events. The mixture of political with social morality,
which we find in both, marks their more advanced age: Solon bears
in this respect the same relation to Simonidês, as his contemporary
Alkæus bears to Archilochus. His poems, as far as we can judge
by the fragments remaining, appear to have been short occasional
effusions,—with the exception of the epic poem respecting the
submerged island of Atlantis; which he began towards the close of
his life, but never finished. They are elegiac, trimeter iambic, and
trochaic tetrameter: in his hands certainly neither of these metres
can be said to have any special or separate character. If the poems
of Solon are short, those of Theognis are much shorter, and are
indeed so much broken (as they stand in our present collection), as
to read like separate epigrams or bursts of feeling, which the poet
had not taken the trouble to incorporate in any definite scheme or
series. They form a singular mixture of maxim and passion,—of general
precept with personal affection towards the youth Kyrnus,—which
surprises us if tried by the standard of literary composition, but
which seems a very genuine manifestation of an impoverished exile’s
complaints and restlessness. What remains to us of Phokylidês,
another of the gnomic poets nearly contemporary with Solon, is
nothing more than a few maxims in verse,—couplets, with the name of
the author in several cases embodied in them.</p>

<p>Amidst all the variety of rhythmical and metrical
innovations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[p. 93]</span> which
have been enumerated, the ancient epic continued to be recited by
the rhapsodes as before, and some new epical compositions were added
to the existing stock: Eugammon of Kyrênê, about the 50th Olympiad,
(580 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>) appears to be the last of
the series. At Athens, especially, both Solon and Peisistratus
manifested great solicitude as well for the recitation as for the
correct preservation of the Iliad. Perhaps its popularity may have
been diminished by the competition of so much lyric and choric
poetry, more showy and striking in its accompaniments, as well as
more changeful in its rhythmical character. Whatever secondary
effect, however, this newer species of poetry may have derived from
such helps, its primary effect was produced by real intellectual or
poetical excellence,—by the thoughts, sentiment, and expression, not
by the accompaniment. For a long time the musical composer and the
poet continued generally to be one and the same person; and besides
those who have acquired sufficient distinction to reach posterity,
we cannot doubt that there were many known only to their own
contemporaries. But with all of them the instrument and the melody
constituted only the inferior part of that which was known by the
name of music,—altogether subordinate to the “thoughts that breathe
and words that burn.”<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181"
class="fnanchor">[181]</a> Exactness and variety of rhythmical
pronunciation gave to the latter their full effect upon a delicate
ear; but such pleasure of the ear was ancillary to the emotion of
mind arising out of the sense conveyed. Complaints are made by the
poets, even so early as 500 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, that
the accompaniment was becoming too prominent. But it was not until
the age of the comic poet Aristophanês, towards the end of the fifth
century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, that the primitive relation
between the instrumental accompaniment and the words was really
reversed,—and loud were the complaints to which it gave rise;<a
id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> the
performance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[p. 94]</span> the
flute or harp then became more elaborate, showy, and overpowering,
while the words were so put together as to show off the player’s
execution. I notice briefly this subsequent revolution for the
purpose of setting forth, by contrast, the truly intellectual
character of the original lyric and choric poetry of Greece; and of
showing how much the vague sentiment arising from mere musical sound
was lost in the more definite emotion, and in the more lasting and
reproductive combinations, generated by poetical meaning.</p>

<p>The name and poetry of Solon, and the short maxims, or sayings,
of Phokylidês, conduct us to the mention of the Seven Wise Men of
Greece. Solon was himself one of the seven, and most if not all
of them were poets, or composers in verse.<a id="FNanchor_183"
href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> To most of them
is ascribed also an abundance of pithy repartees, together with
one short saying, or maxim, peculiar to each, serving as a sort
of distinctive motto;<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184"
class="fnanchor">[184]</a> indeed, the test of an accomplished
man about this time was his talent for singing or reciting
poetry, and for making smart and ready answers. Respecting this
constellation of wise men,—who in the next cen<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_95">[p. 95]</span>tury of Grecian history, when philosophy
came to be a matter of discussion and argumentation, were spoken of
with great eulogy,—all the statements are confused, in part even
contradictory. Neither the number, nor the names, are given by
all authors alike. Dikæarchus numbered ten, Hermippus seventeen:
the names of Solon the Athenian, Thalês the Milesian, Pittakus
the Mitylenean, and Bias the Prienean, were comprised in all the
lists,—and the remaining names as given by Plato<a id="FNanchor_185"
href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> were, Kleobulus
of Lindus in Rhodes, Myson of Chênæ, and Cheilon of Sparta. By
others, however, the names are differently stated: nor can we
certainly distribute among them the sayings, or mottoes, upon which
in later days the Amphiktyons conferred the honor of inscription
in the Delphian temple: Know thyself,—Nothing too much,—Know thy
opportunity,—Suretyship is the precursor of ruin. Bias is praised
as an excellent judge, and Myson was declared by the Delphian
oracle to be the most discreet man among the Greeks, according to
the testimony of the satirical poet Hippônax. This is the oldest
testimony (540 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>) which can be
produced in favor of any of the seven; but Kleobulus of Lindus,
far from being universally extolled, is pronounced by the poet
Simonidês to be a fool.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186"
class="fnanchor">[186]</a> Dikæarchus, however, justly observed, that
these seven or ten persons were not wise men, or philosophers, in the
sense which those words bore in his day, but persons of practical
discernment in reference to man and society,<a id="FNanchor_187"
href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>—of the same turn
of mind as their con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[p.
96]</span>temporary the fabulist Æsop, though not employing the same
mode of illustration. Their appearance forms an epoch in Grecian
history, inasmuch as they are the first persons who ever acquired an
Hellenic reputation grounded on mental competency apart from poetical
genius or effect,—a proof that political and social prudence was
beginning to be appreciated and admired on its own account. Solon,
Pittakus, Bias, and Thalês, were all men of influence—the first two
even men of ascendency,<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188"
class="fnanchor">[188]</a>—in their respective cities. Kleobulus was
despot of Lindus, and Periander (by some numbered among the seven) of
Corinth. Thalês stands distinguished as the earliest name in physical
philosophy, with which the other contemporary wise men are not said
to have meddled; their celebrity rests upon moral, social, and
political wisdom exclusively, which came into greater honor as the
ethical feeling of the Greeks improved and as their experience became
enlarged.</p>

<p>In these celebrated names we have social philosophy in its early
and infantine state,—in the shape of homely sayings or admonitions,
either supposed to be self-evident, or to rest upon some great
authority divine or human, but neither accompanied by reasons nor
recognizing any appeal to inquiry and discussion as the proper
test of their rectitude. From such unsuspecting acquiescence,
the sentiment to which these admonitions owe their force, we are
partially liberated even in the poet Simonidês of Keôs, who (as
before alluded to) severely criticizes the song of Kleobulus as well
as its author. The half-century which followed the age of Simonidês
(the interval between about 480-430 B.&nbsp;C.) broke down that sentiment
more and more, by familiarizing the public with argumentative
controversy in the public assembly, the popular judicature, and
even on the dramatic stage. And the increased self-working of the
Grecian mind, thus created, manifested itself in Sokratês, who laid
open all ethical and social doctrines to the scrutiny of reason,
and who first awakened among his countrymen that love of dialectics
which never left them,—an analytical interest in the mental process
of inquiring out, verifying, proving, and expounding truth. To this
capital item of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[p. 97]</span>
human progress, secured through the Greeks—and through them only—to
mankind generally, our attention will be called at a later period
of the history; at present, it is only mentioned in contrast with
the naked, dogmatical laconism of the Seven Wise Men, and with the
simple enforcement of the early poets: a state in which morality has
a certain place in the feelings,—but no root, even among the superior
minds, in the conscious exercise of reason.</p>

<p>The interval between Archilochus and Solon (660-580
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>) seems, as has been remarked
in my former volume, to be the period in which writing first
came to be applied to Greek poems,—to the Homeric poems among
the number; and shortly after the end of that period, commences
the era of compositions without metre or prose. The philosopher
Pherekydês of Syros, about 550 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, is
called by some the earliest prose-writer; but no prose-writer for
a considerable time afterwards acquired any celebrity,—seemingly
none earlier than Hekatæus of Milêtus,<a id="FNanchor_189"
href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> about 510-490
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,—prose being a subordinate and
ineffective species of composition, not always even perspicuous,
but requiring no small practice before the power was acquired of
rendering it interesting.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190"
class="fnanchor">[190]</a> Down to the generation preceding Sokratês,
the poets continued to be the grand leaders of the Greek mind: until
then, nothing was taught to youth except to read, to remember,
to recite musically and rhythmically, and to comprehend poetical
composition. The comments of preceptors, addressed to their pupils,
may probably have become fuller and more instructive, but the text
still continued to be epic or lyric poetry. We must recollect
also that these poets, so enunciated, were the best masters for
acquiring a full command of the complicated accent and rhythm of
the Greek language,—essential to an educated man in ancient times,
and sure to be detected if not properly acquired. Not to mention
the Choliambist Hippônax, who seems to have been possessed with the
devil of Archilochus, and in part also with his<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_98">[p. 98]</span> genius,—Anakreon, Ibykus, Pindar,
Bacchylidês, Simonidês, and the dramatists of Athens, continue the
line of eminent poets without intermission. After the Persian war,
the requirements of public speaking created a class of rhetorical
teachers, while the gradual spread of physical philosophy widened
the range of instruction: so that prose composition, for speech or
for writing, occupied a larger and larger share of the attention of
men, and was gradually wrought up to high perfection, such as we see
for the first time in Herodotus. But before it became thus improved,
and acquired that style which was the condition of wide-spread
popularity, we may be sure that it had been silently used as a
means of recording information; and that neither the large mass of
geographical matter contained in the Periegêsis of Hekatæus, nor the
map first prepared by his contemporary, Anaximander, could have been
presented to the world, without the previous labors of unpretending
prose writers, who set down the mere results of their own experience.
The acquisition of prose-writing, commencing as it does about the age
of Peisistratus, is not less remarkable as an evidence of past, than
as a means of future, progress.</p>

<p>Of that splendid genius in sculpture and architecture, which shone
forth in Greece after the Persian invasion, the first lineaments only
are discoverable between 600-560 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,
in Corinth, Ægina, Samos, Chios, Ephesus, etc.,—enough, however,
to give evidence of improvement and progress. Glaukus of Chios is
said to have discovered the art of welding iron, and Rhœkus, or
his son Theodôrus of Samos, the art of casting copper or brass in
a mould: both these discoveries, as far as can be made out, appear
to date a little before 600 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small><a
id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>
The primitive memorial,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[p.
99]</span> erected in honor of a god, did not even pretend to be
an image, but was often nothing more than a pillar, a board, a
shapeless stone, a post, etc., fixed so as to mark and consecrate the
locality, and receiving from the neighborhood respectful care and
decoration, as well as worship. Sometimes there was a real statue,
though of the rudest character, carved in wood; and the families
of carvers,—who, from father to son, exercised this profession,
represented in Attica by the name of Dædalus, and in the Ægina by
the name of Smilis,—adhered long, with strict exactness, to the
consecrated type of each particular god. Gradually, the wish grew
up to change the material, as well as to correct the rudeness, of
such primitive idols; sometimes the original wood was retained as
the material, but covered in part with ivory or gold,—in other
cases, marble or metal was substituted. Dipœnos and Skyllis of Krête
acquired renown as workers in marble, about the 50th Olympiad (580
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), and from them downwards a series
of names may be traced, more or less distinguished; moreover, it
seems about the same period that the earliest temple-offerings,
in works of art, properly so called, commence,—the golden statue
of Zeus, and the large carved chest, dedicated by the Kypselids
of Corinth at Olympia.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192"
class="fnanchor">[192]</a> The pious associations, however, connected
with the old type were so strong, that the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_100">[p. 100]</span> hand of the artist was greatly
restrained in dealing with statues of the gods. It was in statues of
men, especially in those of the victors at Olympia and other sacred
games, that genuine ideas of beauty were first aimed at and in part
attained, from whence they passed afterwards to the statues of the
gods. Such statues of the athletes seem to commence somewhere between
Olympiad 53-58, (568-548 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>).</p>

<p>Nor is it until the same interval of time (between 600-550
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>) that we find any traces of these
architectural monuments, by which the more important cities in
Greece afterwards attracted to themselves so much renown. The
two greatest temples in Greece known to Herodotus were, the
Artemision at Ephesus, and the Heræon at Samos: the former of these
seems to have been commenced, by the Samian Theodorus, about 600
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,—the latter, begun by the Samian Rhœkus,
can hardly be traced to any higher antiquity. The first attempts to
decorate Athens by such additions proceeded from Peisistratus and his
sons, near the same time. As far as we can judge, too, in the absence
of all direct evidence, the temples of Pæstum in Italy and Selinus
in Sicily seem to fall in this same century. Of painting, during
these early centuries, nothing can be affirmed; it never at any time
reached the same perfection as sculpture, and we may presume that its
years of infancy were at least equally rude.</p>

<p>The immense development of Grecian art subsequently, and the great
perfection of Grecian artists, are facts of great importance in the
history of the human race. And in regard to the Greeks themselves,
they not only acted powerfully on the taste of the people, but were
also valuable indirectly as the common boast of Hellenism, and as
supplying one bond of fraternal sympathy as well as of mutual pride,
among its widely-dispersed sections. It is the paucity and weakness
of these bonds which renders the history of Greece, prior to 560
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, little better than a series of
parallel, but isolated threads, each attached to a separate city; and
that increased range of joint Hellenic feeling and action, upon which
we shall presently enter, though arising doubtless in great measure
from new and common dangers threatening many cities at once,—also
springs in part from those other causes which have been enumerated in
this chapter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[p. 101]</span> as
acting on the Grecian mind. It proceeds from the stimulus applied to
all the common feelings in religion, art, and recreation,—from the
gradual formation of national festivals, appealing in various ways
to tastes and sentiments which animated every Hellenic bosom,—from
the inspirations of men of genius, poets, musicians, sculptors,
architects, who supplied more or less in every Grecian city,
education for the youth, training for the chorus, and ornament for
the locality,—from the gradual expansion of science, philosophy, and
rhetoric, during the coming period of this history, which rendered
one city the intellectual capital of Greece, and brought to Isokratês
and Plato pupils from the most distant parts of the Grecian world.
It was this fund of common tastes, tendencies, and aptitudes, which
caused the social atoms of Hellas to gravitate towards each other,
and which enabled the Greeks to become something better and greater
than an aggregate of petty disunited communities like the Thracians
or Phrygians. And the creation of such common, extra-political
Hellenism, is the most interesting phenomenon which the historian has
to point out in the early period now under our notice. He is called
upon to dwell upon it the more forcibly, because the modern reader
has generally no idea of national union without political union,—an
association foreign to the Greek mind. Strange as it may seem to find
a song-writer put forward as an active instrument of union among
his fellow-Hellens, it is not the less true, that those poets, whom
we have briefly passed in review, by enriching the common language,
and by circulating from town to town either in person or in their
compositions, contributed to fan the flame of Pan-Hellenic patriotism
at a time when there were few circumstances to coöperate with them,
and when the causes tending to perpetuate isolation seemed in the
ascendant.</p>

    GRECIAN AFFAIRS DURING THE GOVERNMENT OF PEISISTRATUS AND&nbsp;HIS SONS AT ATHENS.</h2>
</div>

<p class="mt1"><span class="smcap">We now</span> arrive at what may
be called the second period of Grecian history, beginning with the
rule of Peisistratus at Athens and of Crœsus in Lydia.</p>

<p>It has been already stated that Peisistratus made himself despot
of Athens in 560 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>: he died in 527
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, and was succeeded by his son
Hippias, who was deposed and expelled in 510 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,
thus making an entire space of fifty years between the
first exaltation of the father and the final expulsion of the
son. These chronological points are settled on good evidence: but
the thirty-three years covered by the reign of Peisistratus are
interrupted by two periods of exile,—one of them lasting not less
than ten years,—the other, five years. And the exact place of
the years of exile, being nowhere laid down upon authority, has
been differently determined by the conjectures of chronologers.<a
id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
Partly from this half-known chronology, partly from a very scanty
collection of facts, the history of the half-century now before
us can only be given very imperfectly: nor can we wonder at our
ignorance, when we find that even among the Athenians themselves,
only a century afterwards, statements the most incorrect and
contradictory respecting the Peisistratids were in circulation, as
Thucydidês distinctly, and somewhat reproachfully, acquaints us.</p>

<p>More than thirty years had now elapsed since the promulgation of
the Solonian constitution, whereby the annual senate of Four Hundred
had been created, and the public assembly (preceded in its action as
well as aided and regulated by this senate) invested with a power
of exacting responsibility from the magis<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_103">[p. 103]</span>trates after their year of office. The
seeds of the subsequent democracy had thus been sown, and no doubt
the administration of the archons had been practically softened by
it; but nothing in the nature of a democratical sentiment had yet
been created. A hundred years hence, we shall find that sentiment
unanimous and potent among the enterprising masses of Athens and
Peiræeus, and shall be called upon to listen to loud complaints of
the difficulty of dealing with “that angry, waspish, intractable
little old man, Dêmus of Pnyx,”—so Aristophanes<a id="FNanchor_194"
href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> calls the Athenian
people to their faces, with a freedom which shows that <i>he</i> at
least counted on their good temper. But between 560-510
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> the people are as passive in respect
to political rights and securities as the most strenuous enemy
of democracy could desire, and the government is transferred
from hand to hand by bargains and cross-changes between two or
three powerful men,<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195"
class="fnanchor">[195]</a> at the head of partisans who echo their
voices, espouse their personal quarrels, and draw the sword at their
command. It was this ancient constitution—Athens as it stood before
the Athenian democracy—which the Macedonian Antipater professed to
restore in 322 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, when he caused
the majority of the poorer citizens to be excluded altogether from
the political franchise.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196"
class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>By the stratagem recounted in a former chapter,<a
id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>
Peisistratus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[p. 104]</span>
had obtained from the public assembly a guard which he had employed
to acquire forcible possession of the acropolis. He thus became
master of the administration; but he employed his power honorably
and well, not disturbing the existing forms farther than was
necessary to insure to himself full mastery. Nevertheless, we may
see by the verses of Solon<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198"
class="fnanchor">[198]</a> (the only contemporary evidence which we
possess), that the prevalent sentiment was by no means favorable to
his recent proceeding, and that there was in many minds a strong
feeling both of terror and aversion, which presently manifested
itself in the armed coalition of his two rivals,—Megaklês at the head
of the Parali, or inhabitants of the sea-board, and Lykurgus at the
head of those in the neighboring plain. As the conjunction of the two
formed a force too powerful for Peisistratus to withstand, he was
driven into exile, after no long possession of his despotism.</p>

<p>But the time came, how soon we cannot tell, when the two rivals
who had expelled him quarrelled, and Megaklês made propositions to
Peisistratus, inviting him to resume the sovereignty, promising
his own aid, and stipulating that Peisistratus should marry his
daughter. The conditions being accepted, a plan was laid between
the two new allies for carrying them into effect, by a novel
stratagem,—since the simulated wounds and pretence of personal
danger were not likely to be played off a second time with success.
The two conspirators clothed a stately woman, six feet high, named
Phyê, in the panoply and costume of Athênê,—surrounded her with the
processional accompaniments belonging to the goddess,—and placed
her in a chariot with Peisistratus by her side. In this guise the
exiled despot and his adherents approached the city and drove up to
the acropolis, preceded by heralds, who cried aloud to the people:
“Athenians, receive ye cordially Peisistratus, whom Athênê has
honored above all other men, and is now bringing back into her own
acropolis.” The people in the city received the reputed goddess
with implicit belief and demonstrations of worship, while among the
country cantons the report quickly spread<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_105">[p. 105]</span> that Athênê had appeared in person to
restore Peisistratus, who thus found himself, without even a show of
resistance, in possession of the acropolis and of the government.
His own party, united with that of Megaklês, were powerful enough
to maintain him, when he had once acquired possession; and probably
all, except the leaders, sincerely believed in the epiphany of the
goddess, which came to be divulged as having been a deception, only
after Peisistratus and Megaklês had quarrelled.<a id="FNanchor_199"
href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[p. 106]</span>The daughter
of Megaklês, according to agreement, quickly became the wife of
Peisistratus, but she bore him no children; and it became known
that her husband, having already adult sons by a former marriage,
and considering that the Kylonian curse rested upon all the
Alkmæônid family, did not intend that she should become a mother.<a
id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
Megaklês was so incensed at this behavior, that he not only renounced
his alliance with Peisistratus, but even made his peace with the
third party, the adherents of Lykurgus,—and assumed so menacing an
attitude, that the despot was obliged to evacuate Attica. He retired
to Eretria in Eubœa, where he remained no less than ten years;
but a considerable portion of that time was employed in making
preparations for a forcible return, and he seems to have exercised,
even while in exile, a degree of influence much exceeding that<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[p. 107]</span> of a private man.
He lent valuable aid to Lygdamis of Naxos,<a id="FNanchor_201"
href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> in constituting
himself despot of that island, and he possessed, we know not how,
the means of rendering valuable service to different cities, Thebes
in particular. They repaid him by large contributions of money to
aid in his reëstablishment: mercenaries were hired from Argos, and
the Naxian Lygdamis came himself, both with money and with troops.
Thus equipped and aided, Peisistratus landed at Marathon in Attica.
How the Athenian government had been conducted during his ten years’
absence, we do not know; but the leaders of it permitted him to
remain undisturbed at Marathon, and to assemble his partisans both
from the city and from the country: nor was it until he broke up
from Marathon and had reached Pallênê on his way to Athens, that
they took the field against him. Moreover, their conduct, even when
the two armies were near together, must have been either extremely
negligent or corrupt; for Peisistratus found means to attack them
unprepared, routing their forces almost without resistance. In fact,
the proceedings have altogether the air of a concerted betrayal:
for the defeated troops, though unpursued, are said to have
dispersed and returned to their homes forthwith, in obedience to the
proclamation of Peisistratus, who marched on to Athens, and found
himself a third time ruler.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202"
class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>On this third successful entry, he took vigorous precautions for
rendering his seat permanent. The Alkmæônidæ and their immediate
partisans retired into exile; but he seized the children of those
who remained, and whose sentiments he suspected, as hostages for
the behavior of their parents, and placed them in Naxos, under the
care of Lygdamis. Moreover, he provided himself with a powerful body
of Thracian mercenaries, paid by taxes levied upon the people:<a
id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> nor
did he omit to conciliate the favor of the gods by a purification of
the sacred island of Delos:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[p.
108]</span> all the dead bodies which had been buried within sight
of the temple of Apollo were exhumed and reinterred farther off.
At this time the Delian festival,—attended by the Asiatic Ionians
and the islanders, and with which Athens was of course peculiarly
connected,—must have been beginning to decline from its pristine
magnificence; for the subjugation of the continental Ionic cities
by Cyrus had been already achieved, and the power of Samos, though
increased under the despot Polykratês, seems to have increased at
the expense and to the ruin of the smaller Ionic islands. From
the same feelings, in part, which led to the purification of
Delos,—partly as an act of party revenue,—Peisistratus caused the
houses of the Alkmæônids to be levelled with the ground, and the
bodies of the deceased members of that family to be disinterred and
cast out of the country.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204"
class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p>This third and last period of the rule of Peisistratus lasted
several years, until his death in 527 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>:
it is said to have been so mild in its character, that he
once even suffered himself to be cited for trial before the Senate
of Areopagus; yet as we know that he had to maintain a large body
of Thracian mercenaries out of the funds of the people, we shall
be inclined to construe this eulogium comparatively rather than
positively. Thucydidês affirms that both he and his sons governed
in a wise and virtuous spirit, levying from the people only an
income-tax of five per cent.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205"
class="fnanchor">[205]</a> This is high praise coming from such an
au<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[p. 109]</span>thority, though
it seems that we ought to make some allowance for the circumstance of
Thucydidês being connected by descent with the Peisistratid family.<a
id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> The
judgment of Herodotus is also very favorable respecting Peisistratus;
that of Aristotle favorable, yet qualified,—since he includes these
despots among the list of those who undertook public and sacred works
with the deliberate view of impoverishing as well as of occupying
their subjects. This supposition is countenanced by the prodigious
scale upon which the temple of Zeus Olympius at Athens was begun by
Peisistratus,—a scale much exceeding either the Parthenôn or the
temple of Athênê Polias, both of which were erected in later times,
when the means of Athens were decidedly larger,<a id="FNanchor_207"
href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> and her disposition
to demonstrative piety certainly no way diminished. It was left by
him unfinished, nor was it ever completed until the Roman emperor
Hadrian undertook the task. Moreover, Peisistratus introduced the
greater Panathenaic festival, solemnized every four years, in the
third Olympic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[p. 110]</span>
year: the annual Panathenaic festival, henceforward called the
Lesser, was still continued.</p>

<p>I have already noticed, at considerable length, the care
which he bestowed in procuring full and correct copies of the
Homeric poems, as well as in improving the recitation of them
at the Panathenaic festival,—a proceeding for which we owe him
much gratitude, but which has been shown to be erroneously
interpreted by various critics. He probably also collected the
works of other poets,—called by Aulus Gellius,<a id="FNanchor_208"
href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> in language not
well suited to the sixth century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,
a library thrown open to the public; and the service which he thus
rendered must have been highly valuable at a time when writing
and reading were not widely extended. His son Hipparchus followed
up the same taste, taking pleasure in the society of the most
eminent poets of the day,<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209"
class="fnanchor">[209]</a>—Simonidês, Anakreon, and Lasus; not to
mention the Athenian mystic Onomakritus, who, though not pretending
to the gift of prophecy himself, passed for the proprietor and editor
of the various prophecies ascribed to the ancient name of Musæus. The
Peisistratids were well versed in these prophecies, and set great
value upon them; but Onomakritus, being detected on one occasion in
the act of interpolating the prophecies of Musæus, was banished by
Hipparchus in consequence.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210"
class="fnanchor">[210]</a> The statues of Hermês, erected by this
prince or by his personal friends in various parts of Attica,<a
id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>
and inscribed with short moral sentences, are extolled by the author
of the Platonic dialogue called Hipparchus, with an exaggeration
which approaches to irony; but it is certain that both the sons
of Peisistratus, as well as himself, were exact in fulfilling
the religious obligations of the state, and ornamented the city
in several ways, especially the public fountain Kallirrhoê. They
are said to have maintained the preëxisting forms of law and
justice, merely taking care always to keep themselves and their
adherents in the effective<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[p.
111]</span> offices of state, and in the full reality of power.
They were, moreover, modest and popular in their personal demeanor,
and charitable to the poor; yet one striking example occurs of
unscrupulous enmity, in their murder of Kimôn, by night, through the
agency of hired assassins.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212"
class="fnanchor">[212]</a> There is good reason, however, for
believing that the government both of Peisistratus and of his sons
was in practice generally mild until after the death of Hipparchus
by the hands of Harmodius and Aristogeitôn, after which event the
surviving Hippias became alarmed, cruel, and oppressive during his
last four years. And the harshness of this concluding period left
upon the Athenian mind<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213"
class="fnanchor">[213]</a> that profound and imperishable hatred,
against the dynasty generally, which Thucydidês attests,—though he
labors to show that it was not deserved by Peisistratus, nor at first
by Hippias.</p>

<p>Peisistratus left three legitimate sons,—Hippias, Hipparchus, and
Thessalus: the general belief at Athens among the contemporaries of
Thucydidês was, that Hipparchus was the eldest of the three and had
succeeded him; but the historian emphatically pronounces this to be a
mistake, and certifies, upon his own responsibility, that Hippias was
both eldest son and successor. Such an assurance from him, fortified
by certain reasons in themselves not very conclusive, is sufficient
ground for our belief,—the more so as Herodotus countenances the
same version. But we are surprised at such a degree of historical
carelessness in the Athenian public, and seemingly even in Plato,<a
id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>
about a matter both interesting and comparatively recent. In order to
abate this surprise, and to explain how the name of Hipparchus came
to supplant that of Hippias in the popular talk, Thucydidês recounts
the memorable story of Harmodius and Aristogeitôn.</p>

<p>Of these two Athenian citizens,<a id="FNanchor_215"
href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> both belonging to
the ancient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[p. 112]</span> gens
called Gephyræi, the former was a beautiful youth, attached to the
latter by a mutual friendship and devoted intimacy, which Grecian
manners did not condemn. Hipparchus made repeated propositions to
Harmodius, which were repelled, but which, on becoming known to
Aristogeitôn, excited both his jealousy and his fears lest the
disappointed suitor should employ force,—fears justified by the
proceedings not unusual with Grecian despots,<a id="FNanchor_216"
href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> and by the absence of
all legal protection against outrage from such a quarter. Under these
feelings, he began to look about, in the best way that he could,
for some means of putting down the despotism. Meanwhile Hipparchus,
though not entertaining any designs of violence, was so incensed at
the refusal of Harmodius, that he could not be satisfied without
doing something to insult or humiliate him. In order to conceal
the motive from which the insult really proceeded, he offered it,
not directly to Harmodius, but to his sister. He caused this young
maiden to be one day summoned to take her station in a religious
procession as one of the kanêphoræ, or basket carriers, according
to the practice usual at Athens; but when she arrived at the place
where her fellow-maidens were assembled, she was dismissed with scorn
as unworthy of so respectable a function, and the summons addressed
to her was disavowed.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217"
class="fnanchor">[217]</a> An insult thus publicly offered<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[p. 113]</span> filled Harmodius
with indignation, and still farther exasperated the feelings of
Aristogeitôn: both of them, resolving at all hazards to put an end
to the despotism, concerted means for aggression with a few select
associates. They awaited the festival of the Great Panathenæa,
wherein the body of the citizens were accustomed to march up in
armed procession, with spear and shield, to the acropolis; this
being the only day on which an armed body could come together
without suspicion. The conspirators appeared armed like the rest
of the citizens, but carrying concealed daggers besides. Harmodius
and Aristogeitôn undertook with their own hands to kill the two
Peisistratids, while the rest promised to stand forward immediately
for their protection against the foreign mercenaries; and though
the whole number of persons engaged was small, they counted upon
the spontaneous sympathies of the armed bystanders in an effort to
regain their liberties, so soon as the blow should once be struck.
The day of the festival having arrived, Hippias, with his foreign
body-guard around him, was marshalling the armed citizens for
procession, in the Kerameikus without the gates, when Harmodius and
Aristogeitôn approached with concealed daggers to execute their
purpose. On coming near, they were thunderstruck to behold one of
their own fellow-conspirators talking familiarly with Hippias, who
was of easy access to every man, and they immediately concluded
that the plot was betrayed. Expecting to be seized, and wrought
up to a state of desperation, they resolved at least not to die
without having revenged themselves on Hipparchus, whom they found
within the city gates near the chapel called the Leôkorion, and
immediately slew him. His attendant guards killed Harmodius on the
spot; while Aristogeitôn, rescued for the moment by the surrounding
crowd, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[p. 114]</span>
afterwards taken, and perished in the tortures applied to make him
disclose his accomplices.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218"
class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p>The news flew quickly to Hippias in the Kerameikus, who heard it
earlier than the armed citizens near him, awaiting his order for the
commencement of the procession. With extraordinary self-command,
he took advantage of this precious instant of foreknowledge, and
advanced towards them,—commanding them to drop their arms for a
short time, and assemble on an adjoining ground. They unsuspectingly
obeyed, and he immediately directed his guards to take possession of
the vacant arms. He was now undisputed master, and enabled to seize
the persons of all those citizens whom he mistrusted,—especially all
those who had daggers about them, which it was not the practice to
carry in the Panathenaic procession.</p>

<p>Such is the memorable narrative of Harmodius and Aristogeitôn,
peculiarly valuable inasmuch as it all comes from Thucydidês.<a
id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a>
To possess great power,—to be above legal restraint,—to inspire
extraordinary fear,—is a privilege so much coveted by the giants
among mankind, that we may well take notice of those cases in which
it brings misfortune even upon themselves. The fear inspired by
Hipparchus,—of designs which he did not really entertain, but was
likely to entertain, and competent to execute without hindrance,—was
here the grand cause of his destruction.</p>

<p>The conspiracy here detailed happened in 514
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, during the thirteenth year of the
reign of Hippias,—which lasted four years longer, until 510
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> And these last four years, in the belief
of the Athenian public, counted for his whole reign; nay, many of
them made the still greater historical mistake of eliding these
last four years altogether, and of supposing that the conspiracy
of Harmodius and Aristogeitôn had deposed the Peisistratid
gov<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[p. 115]</span>ernment and
liberated Athens. Both poets and philosophers shared this faith,
which is distinctly put forth in the beautiful and popular Skolion
or song on the subject: the two friends are there celebrated as
the authors of liberty at Athens,—“they slew the despot and gave
to Athens equal laws.”<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220"
class="fnanchor">[220]</a> So inestimable a present was alone
sufficient to enshrine in the minds of the subsequent democracy
those who had sold their lives to purchase it: and we must farther
recollect that the intimate connection between the two, so repugnant
to the modern reader, was regarded at Athens with sympathy,—so that
the story took hold of the Athenian mind by the vein of romance
conjointly with that of patriotism. Harmodius and Aristogeitôn were
afterwards commemorated both as the winners and as the protomartyrs
of Athenian liberty. Statues were erected in their honor shortly
after the final expulsion of the Peisistratids; immunity from taxes
and public burdens was granted to the descendants of their families;
and the speaker who proposed the abolition of such immunities,
at a time when the number had been abusively multiplied, made
his only special exception in favor of this respected lineage.<a
id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>
And since the name of Hipparchus was universally notorious as the
person slain, we discover how it was that he came to be considered by
an uncritical public as the predominant member of the Peisistratid
family,—the eldest son and successor of Peisistratus,—the reigning
despot,—to the comparative neglect of Hippias. The same public
probably cherished many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[p.
116]</span> other anecdotes,<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222"
class="fnanchor">[222]</a> not the less eagerly believed because they
could not be authenticated, respecting this eventful period.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the moderation of Hippias before,
indignation at the death of his brother, and fear for
his own safety,<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223"
class="fnanchor">[223]</a> now induced him to drop it altogether. It
is attested both by Thucydidês and Herodotus, and admits of no doubt,
that his power was now employed harshly and cruelly,—that he put to
death a considerable number of citizens. We find also a statement,
noway improbable in itself, and affirmed both in Pausanias and in
Plutarch,—inferior authorities, yet still in this case sufficiently
credible,—that he caused Leæna, the mistress of Aristogeitôn, to
be tortured to death, in order to extort from her a knowledge of
the secrets and accomplices of the latter.<a id="FNanchor_224"
href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> But as he could not
but be sensible that this system of terrorism was full of peril to
himself, so he looked out for shelter and support in case of being
expelled from Athens; and with this view he sought to connect himself
with Darius king of Persia,—a connection full of consequences to
be hereafter developed. Æantidês, son of Hippoklus the despot of
Lampsakus on the Hellespont, stood high at this time in the favor of
the Persian monarch, which induced Hippias to give him his daughter
Archedikê in marriage; no small honor to the Lampsakene, in the
estimation of Thucydidês.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225"
class="fnanchor">[225]</a> To explain how Hippias came to fix upon
this town, however, it is necessary to say a few words on the foreign
policy of the Peisistratids.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[p. 117]</span>It has already
been mentioned that the Athenians, even so far back as the days of
the poet Alkæus, had occupied Sigeium in the Troad, and had there
carried on war with the Mityleneans; so that their acquisitions
in these regions date much before the time of Peisistratus. Owing
probably to this circumstance, an application was made to them in the
early part of his reign from the Dolonkian Thracians, inhabitants
of the Chersonese on the opposite side of the Hellespont, for aid
against their powerful neighbors the Absinthian tribe of Thracians;
and opportunity was thus offered for sending out a colony to acquire
this valuable peninsula for Athens. Peisistratus willingly entered
into the scheme, and Miltiadês son of Kypselus, a noble Athenian,
living impatiently under his despotism, was no less pleased to take
the lead in executing it: his departure and that of other malcontents
as founders of a colony suited the purpose of all parties. According
to the narrative of Herodotus,—alike pious and picturesque,—and
doubtless circulating as authentic at the annual games which the
Chersonesites, even in his time, celebrated to the honor of their
œkist,—it is the Delphian god who directs the scheme and singles
out the individual. The chiefs of the distressed Dolonkians went
to Delphi to crave assistance towards procuring Grecian colonists,
and were directed to choose for their œkist the individual who
should first show them hospitality on their quitting the temple.
They departed and marched all along what was called the Sacred
Road, through Phocis and Bœotia to Athens, without receiving a
single hospitable invitation; at length they entered Athens, and
passed by the house of Miltiadês, while he himself was sitting in
front of it. Seeing men whose costume and arms marked them out as
strangers, he invited them into his house and treated them kindly:
they then apprized him that he was the man fixed upon by the oracle,
and abjured him not to refuse his concurrence. After asking for
himself personally the opinion of the oracle, and receiving an
affirmative answer, he consented; sailing as œkist, at the head of a
body of Athenian emigrants, to the Chersonese.<a id="FNanchor_226"
href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p>

<p>Having reached this peninsula, and having been constituted
despot of the mixed Thracian and Athenian population, he lost<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[p. 118]</span> no time in fortifying
the narrow isthmus by a wall reaching all across from Kardia to
Paktya, a distance of about four miles and a half; so that the
Absinthian invaders were for the time effectually shut out,<a
id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>
though the protection was not permanently kept up. He also entered
into a war with Lampsakus, on the Asiatic side of the strait, but was
unfortunate enough to fall into an ambuscade and become a prisoner.
Nothing preserved his life except the immediate interference of
Crœsus king of Lydia, coupled with strenuous menaces addressed
to the Lampsakenes, who found themselves compelled to release
their prisoner; Miltiadês having acquired much favor with this
prince, in what manner we are not told. He died childless some
time afterwards, while his nephew Stesagoras, who succeeded him,
perished by assassination, some time subsequent to the death of
Peisistratus at Athens.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228"
class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p>The expedition of Miltiadês to the Chersonese must have occurred
early after the first usurpation of Peisistratus, since even his
imprisonment by the Lampsakenes happened before the ruin of Crœsus,
(546 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>). But it was not till much
later,—probably during the third and most powerful period of
Peisistratus,—that the latter undertook his expedition against
Sigeium in the Troad. This place appears to have fallen into the
hands of the Mityleneans: Peisistratus retook it,<a id="FNanchor_229"
href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> and placed there his
illegitimate son Hegesistratus as despot. The Mityleneans may<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[p. 119]</span> have been enfeebled
at this time (somewhere between 537-527 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>)
not only by the strides of Persian conquest on the
mainland, but also by the ruinous defeat which they suffered from
Polykratês and the Samians.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230"
class="fnanchor">[230]</a> Hegesistratus maintained the place against
various hostile attempts, throughout all the reign of Hippias, so
that the Athenian possessions in those regions comprehended at
this period both the Chersonese and Sigeium.<a id="FNanchor_231"
href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> To the former of
the two, Hippias sent out Miltiadês, nephew of the first œkist, as
governor, after the death of his brother Stesagoras. The new governor
found much discontent in the peninsula, but succeeded in subduing
it by entrapping and imprisoning the principal men in each town. He
farther took into his pay a regiment of five hundred mercenaries,
and married Hegesipylê, daughter of the Thracian king Olorus.<a
id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> It
appears to have been about 515 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> that
this second Miltiadês went out to the Chersonese.<a id="FNanchor_233"
href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> He seems to have
been obliged to quit it for a time, after the Scythian expedition
of Darius, in consequence of having incurred the hostility of the
Persians; but he was there from the beginning of the Ionic revolt
until about 493 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, or two or three
years before the battle of Marathon, on which occasion we shall find
him acting commander of the Athenian army.</p>

<p>Both the Chersonese and Sigeium, though Athenian possessions, were
however now tributary and dependent on Persia. And it was to this
quarter that Hippias, during his last years of alarm, looked for
support in the event of being expelled from Athens: he calculated
upon Sigeium as a shelter, and upon Æantidês, as well as Darius, as
an ally. Neither the one nor the other failed him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[p. 120]</span>The same
circumstances which alarmed Hippias, and rendered his dominion in
Attica at once more oppressive and more odious, tended of course
to raise the hopes of his enemies, the Athenian exiles, with
the powerful Alkmæônids at their head. Believing the favorable
moment to be come, they even ventured upon an invasion of Attica,
and occupied a post called Leipsydrion in the mountain range of
Parnês, which separates Attica from Bœotia.<a id="FNanchor_234"
href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> But their schemes
altogether failed: Hippias defeated and drove them out of the
country. His dominion now seemed confirmed, for the Lacedæmonians
were on terms of intimate friendship with him; and Amyntas king of
Macedon, as well as the Thessalians, were his allies. Yet the exiles
whom he had beaten in the open field succeeded in an unexpected
manœuvre, which, favored by circumstances, proved his ruin.</p>

<p>By an accident which had occurred in the year 548
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235"
class="fnanchor">[235]</a> the Delphian temple was set on fire
and burnt. To repair this grave loss was an object of solicitude
to all Greece; but the outlay required was exceedingly heavy, and
it appears to have been long before the money could be collected.
The Amphiktyons decreed that one-fourth of the cost should be
borne by the Delphians themselves, who found themselves so heavily
taxed by this assessment, that they sent envoys throughout all
Greece to collect subscriptions in aid, and received, among
other donations, from the Greek settlers in Egypt twenty minæ,
besides a large present of alum from the Egyptian king Amasis:
their munificent benefactor Crœsus fell a victim to the Persians
in 546 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, so that his treasure was no
longer open to them. The total sum required was three hundred
talents (equal probably to about one hundred and fifteen thousand
pounds sterling),<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236"
class="fnanchor">[236]</a>—a prodigious amount to be collected from
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[p. 121]</span> dispersed
Grecian cities, who acknowledged no common sovereign authority,
and among whom the proportion reasonable to ask from each was
so difficult to determine with satisfaction to all parties. At
length, however, the money was collected, and the Amphiktyons were
in a situation to make a contract for the building of the temple.
The Alkmæônids, who had been in exile ever since the third and
final acquisition of power by Peisistratus, took the contract;
and in executing it, they not only performed the work in the best
manner, but even went much beyond the terms stipulated; employing
Parian marble for the frontage, where the material prescribed to
them was coarse stone.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237"
class="fnanchor">[237]</a> As was before remarked in the case of
Peisistratus when he was in banishment, we are surprised to find
exiles whose property had been confiscated so amply furnished with
money,—unless we are to suppose that Kleisthenês the Alkmæônid,
grandson of the Sikyonian Kleisthenês,<a id="FNanchor_238"
href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> inherited through his
mother wealth independent of Attica, and deposited it in the temple
of the Samian Hêrê. But the fact is unquestionable, and they gained
signal reputation throughout the Hellenic world for their liberal
performance of so important an enterprise. That the erection took
considerable time, we cannot doubt. It seems to have been finished,
as far as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[p. 122]</span> we can
conjecture, about a year or two after the death of Hipparchus,—512
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,—more than thirty years after the
conflagration.</p>

<p>To the Delphians, especially, the rebuilding of their temple on
so superior a scale was the most essential of all services, and
their gratitude towards the Alkmæônids was proportionally great.
Partly through such a feeling, partly through pecuniary presents,
Kleisthenês was thus enabled to work the oracle for political
purposes, and to call forth the powerful arm of Sparta against
Hippias. Whenever any Spartan presented himself to consult the
oracle, either on private or public business, the answer of the
priestess was always in one strain, “Athens must be liberated.”
The constant repetition of this mandate at length extorted from
the piety of the Lacedæmonians a reluctant compliance. Reverence
for the god overcame their strong feeling of friendship towards
the Peisistratids, and Anchimolius son of Aster was despatched by
sea to Athens, at the head of a Spartan force to expel them. On
landing at Phalêrum, however, he found them already forewarned and
prepared, as well as farther strengthened by one thousand horse
specially demanded from their allies in Thessaly. Upon the plain of
Phalêrum, this latter force was found peculiarly effective, so that
the division of Anchimolius was driven back to their ships with great
loss and he himself slain.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239"
class="fnanchor">[239]</a> The defeated armament had probably been
small, and its repulse only provoked the Lacedæmonians to send a
larger, under the command of their king Kleomenês in person, who on
this occasion marched into Attica by land. On reaching the plain of
Athens, he was assailed by the Thessalian horse, but repelled them
in so gallant a style, that they at once rode off and returned to
their native country; abandoning their allies with a faithlessness
not unfrequent in the Thessalian character. Kleomenês marched on to
Athens without farther resistance, and found himself, together with
the Alkmæônids and the malcontent Athenians generally, in possession
of the town. At that time there was no fortification except around
the acropolis, into which Hippias retired with his mercenaries and
the citizens most faithful to him; having taken care to provision it
well beforehand, so that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[p.
123]</span> was not less secure against famine than against assault.
He might have defied the besieging force, which was noway prepared
for a long blockade; but, not altogether confiding in his position,
he tried to send his children by stealth out of the country; and in
this proceeding the children were taken prisoners. To procure their
restoration, Hippias consented to all that was demanded of him, and
withdrew from Attica to Sigeium in the Troad within the space of five
days.</p>

<p>Thus fell the Peisistratid dynasty in 510 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,
fifty years after the first usurpation of its founder.<a
id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>
It was put down through the aid of foreigners,<a id="FNanchor_241"
href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> and those foreigners,
too, wishing well to it in their hearts, though hostile from a
mistaken feeling of divine injunction. Yet both the circumstances of
its fall, and the course of events which followed, conspire to show
that it possessed few attached friends in the country, and that the
expulsion of Hippias was welcomed unanimously by the vast majority of
Athenians. His family and chief partisans would accompany him into
exile,—probably as a matter of course, without requiring any formal
sentence of condemnation; and an altar was erected in the acropolis,
with a column hard by, commemorating both the past iniquity
of the dethroned dynasty, and the names of all its members.<a

    GRECIAN AFFAIRS AFTER THE EXPULSION OF THE PEISISTRATIDS. — REVOLUTION
    OF&nbsp;KLEISTHENES AND&nbsp;ESTABLISHMENT OF&nbsp;DEMOCRACY AT&nbsp;ATHENS.</h2>
</div>

<p class="mt1"><span class="smcap">With</span> Hippias disappeared
the mercenary Thracian garrison, upon which he and his father
before him had leaned for defence as well as for enforcement of
authority; and Kleomenês with his Lacedæmonian forces retired also,
after staying only long enough to establish a personal friendship,
productive subsequently of important consequences, between the
Spartan king and the Athenian Isagoras. The Athenians were thus left
to them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[p. 127]</span>selves,
without any foreign interference to constrain them in their political
arrangements.</p>

<p>It has been mentioned in the preceding chapter, that the
Peisistratids had for the most part respected the forms of the
Solonian constitution: the nine archons, and the probouleutic or
preconsidering Senate of Four Hundred (both annually changed),
still continued to subsist, together with occasional meetings
of the people,—or rather of such portion of the people as was
comprised in the gentes, phratries, and four Ionic tribes. The
timocratic classification of Solon (or quadruple scale of income and
admeasurement of political franchises according to it) also continued
to subsist,—but all within the tether and subservient to the
purposes of the ruling family, who always kept one of their number
as real master, among the chief administrators, and always retained
possession of the acropolis as well as of the mercenary force.</p>

<p>That overawing pressure being now removed by the expulsion of
Hippias, the enslaved forms became at once endued with freedom
and reality. There appeared again, what Attica had not known for
thirty years, declared political parties, and pronounced opposition
between two men as leaders,—on one side, Isagoras son of Tisander,
a person of illustrious descent,—on the other, Kleisthenês the
Alkmæônid, not less illustrious, and possessing at this moment a
claim on the gratitude of his countrymen as the most persevering as
well as the most effective foe of the dethroned despots. In what
manner such opposition was carried on we are not told. It would seem
to have been not altogether pacific; but at any rate, Kleisthenês
had the worst of it, and in consequence of this defeat, says the
historian, “he took into partnership the people, who had been before
excluded from everything.”<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243"
class="fnanchor">[243]</a> His partnership with the people gave birth
to the Athenian democracy: it was a real and important revolution.</p>

<p>The political franchise, or the character of an Athenian citizen,
both before and since Solon, had been confined to the primitive<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[p. 128]</span> four Ionic tribes,
each of which was an aggregate of so many close corporations or
quasi-families,—the gentes and the phratries. None of the residents
in Attica, therefore, except those included in some gens or phratry,
had any part in the political franchise. Such non-privileged
residents were probably at all times numerous, and became more and
more so by means of fresh settlers: moreover, they tended most to
multiply in Athens and Peiræus, where emigrants would commonly
establish themselves. Kleisthenês broke down the existing wall of
privilege, and imparted the political franchise to the excluded
mass. But this could not be done by enrolling them in new gentes
or phratries, created in addition to the old; for the gentile tie
was founded upon old faith and feeling, which, in the existing
state of the Greek mind, could not be suddenly conjured up as a
bond of union for comparative strangers: it could only be done by
disconnecting the franchise altogether from the Ionic tribes as well
as from the gentes which constituted them, and by redistributing the
population into new tribes with a character and purpose exclusively
political. Accordingly, Kleisthenês abolished the four Ionic tribes,
and created in their place ten new tribes founded upon a different
principle, independent of the gentes and phratries. Each of his
new tribes comprised a certain number of demes or cantons, with
the enrolled proprietors and residents in each of them. The demes
taken altogether included the entire surface of Attica, so that the
Kleisthenean constitution admitted to the political franchise all the
free native Athenians; and not merely these, but also many Metics,
and even some of the superior order of slaves.<a id="FNanchor_244"
href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> Putting out of
sight the general body of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[p.
129]</span> slaves, and regarding only the free inhabitants, it was
in point of fact a scheme approaching to universal suffrage, both
political and judicial.</p>

<p>The slight and cursory manner in which Herodotus announces this
memorable revolution tends to make us overlook its real importance.
He dwells chiefly on the alteration in the number and names of
the tribes: Kleisthenês, he says, despised the Ionians so much,
that he would not tolerate the continuance in Attica of the four
tribes which prevailed in the Ionic cities,<a id="FNanchor_245"
href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> deriving their names
from the four sons of Ion,—just as his grandfather, the Sikyonian
Kleisthenês, hating the Dorians, had degraded and nicknamed the three
Dorian tribes at Sikyôn. Such is the representation of Herodotus, who
seems himself to have entertained some contempt for the Ionians,<a
id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>
and therefore to have suspected a similar feeling where it had no
real existence. But the scope of Kleisthenês was something far more
extensive: he abolished the four ancient tribes, not because they
were Ionic, but because they had become incommensurate with the
existing condition of the Attic people, and because such abolition
procured both for himself and for his political scheme new as well
as hearty allies. And indeed, if we study the circumstances of the
case, we shall see very obvious reasons to suggest the proceeding.
For more than thirty years—an entire generation—the old constitution
had been a mere empty formality, working only in subservience to
the reigning dynasty, and stripped of all real controlling power.
We may be very sure, therefore, that both the Senate of Four
Hundred and the popular assembly, divested of that free speech
which imparted to them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[p.
130]</span> not only all their value but all their charm, had come
to be of little public estimation, and were probably attended only
by a few partisans; and thus the difference between qualified
citizens and men not so qualified,—between members of the four old
tribes, and men not members,—became during this period practically
effaced. This, in fact, was the only species of good which a Grecian
despotism ever seems to have done: it confounded the privileged and
the non-privileged under one coercive authority common to both, so
that the distinction between the two was not easy to revive when the
despotism passed away. As soon as Hippias was expelled, the senate
and the public assembly regained their efficiency. But had they been
continued on the old footing, including none except members of the
four tribes, these tribes would have been reinvested with a privilege
which in reality they had so long lost, that its revival would have
seemed an odious novelty, and the remaining population would probably
not have submitted to it. If, in addition, we consider the political
excitement of the moment,—the restoration of one body of men from
exile, and the departure of another body into exile,—the outpouring
of long-suppressed hatred, partly against these very forms, by
the corruption of which the despot had reigned,—we shall see that
prudence as well as patriotism dictated the adoption of an enlarged
scheme of government. Kleisthenês had learned some wisdom during
his long exile; and as he probably continued, for some time after
the introduction of his new constitution, to be the chief adviser
of his countrymen, we may consider their extraordinary success as a
testimony to his prudence and skill not less than to their courage
and unanimity.</p>

<p>Nor does it seem unreasonable to give him credit for a more
generous forward movement than what is implied in the literal account
of Herodotus. Instead of being forced against his will to purchase
popular support by proposing this new constitution, Kleisthenês may
have proposed it before, during the discussions which immediately
followed the retirement of Hippias; so that the rejection of it
formed the ground of quarrel—and no other ground is mentioned—between
him and Isagoras. The latter doubtless found sufficient support, in
the existing senate and public assembly, to prevent it from being
carried without an actual appeal to the people, and his opposition
to it is not difficult to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[p.
131]</span> understand. For, necessary as the change had become,
it was not the less a shock to ancient Attic ideas. It radically
altered the very idea of a tribe, which now became an aggregation
of demes, not of gentes,—of fellow-demots, not of fellow-gentiles;
and it thus broke up those associations, religious, social, and
political, between the whole and the parts of the old system, which
operated powerfully on the mind of every old-fashioned Athenian.
The patricians at Rome, who composed the gentes and curiæ,—and the
plebs, who had no part in these corporations,—formed for a long time
two separate and opposing fractions in the same city, each with its
own separate organization. It was only by slow degrees that the
plebs gained ground, and the political value of the patrician gens
was long maintained alongside of and apart from the plebeian tribe.
So too in the Italian and German cities of the Middle Ages, the
patrician families refused to part with their own separate political
identity, when the guilds grew up by the side of them; even though
forced to renounce a portion of their power, they continued to be
a separate fraternity, and would not submit to be regimented anew,
under an altered category and denomination, along with the traders
who had grown into wealth and importance.<a id="FNanchor_247"
href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> But the reform of
Kleisthenês effected this change all at once, both as to the name and
as to the reality. In some cases, indeed, that which had been the
name of a gens was retained as the name of a deme, but even then the
old gentiles were ranked indiscriminately among the remaining demots;
and the Athenian people, politically considered, thus became one
homogeneous whole, distributed for convenience into parts, numerical,
local, and politically equal. It is, however, to be remembered, that
while the four Ionic tribes were abolished, the gentes and phratries
which composed them were left untouched, and continued to subsist
as family and religious associations, though carrying with them no
political privilege.</p>

<p>The ten newly-created tribes, arranged in an established order
of precedence, were called,—Erechthêis, Ægêis, Pandiŏnis,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[p. 132]</span> Leontis, Akamantis,
Œnêis, Kekrŏpis, Hippothoöntis, Æantis, Antiochis; names
borrowed chiefly from the respected heroes of Attic legend.<a
id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>
This number remained unaltered until the year 305 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,
when it was increased to twelve by the
addition of two new tribes, Antigonias and Demetrias, afterwards
designated anew by the names of Ptolemais and Attalis. The mere
names of these last two, borrowed from living kings, and not from
legendary heroes, betray the change from freedom to subservience at
Athens. Each tribe comprised a certain number of demes,—cantons,
parishes, or townships,—in Attica. But the total number of these
demes is not distinctly ascertained; for though we know that,
in the time of Polemô (the third century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>),
it was one hundred and seventy-four, we cannot be
sure that it had always remained the same; and several critics
construe the words of Herodotus to imply that Kleisthenês at first
recognized exactly one hundred demes, distributed in equal proportion
among his ten tribes.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249"
class="fnanchor">[249]</a> But such construction of the words is
more than doubtful, while the fact itself is improbable; partly
because if the change of number had been so considerable as the
difference between one hundred and one hundred and seventy-four,
some positive evidence of it would probably be found,—partly because
Kleisthenês would, indeed, have a motive to render the amount of
citizen population nearly equal, but no motive to render the number
of demes equal, in each of the ten tribes. It is well known how great
is the force of local habits, and how unalterable are parochial
or cantonal boundaries. In the absence of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_133">[p. 133]</span> proof to the contrary, therefore, we
may reasonably suppose the number and circumscription of the demes,
as found or modified by Kleisthenês, to have subsisted afterwards
with little alteration, at least until the increase in the number of
the tribes.</p>

<p>There is another point, however, which is at once more certain,
and more important to notice. The demes which Kleisthenês assigned to
each tribe were in no case all adjacent to each other; and therefore
the tribe, as a whole, did not correspond with any continuous portion
of the territory, nor could it have any peculiar local interest,
separate from the entire community. Such systematic avoidance of
the factions arising out of neighborhood will appear to have been
more especially necessary, when we recollect that the quarrels of
the Parali, the Diakrii, the Pediaki, during the preceding century,
had all been generated from local feud, though doubtless artfully
fomented by individual ambition. Moreover, it was only by this
same precaution that the local predominance of the city, and the
formation of a city-interest distinct from that of the country,
was obviated; which could hardly have failed to arise had the city
by itself constituted either one deme or one tribe. Kleisthenês
distributed the city (or found it already distributed) into several
demes, and those demes among several tribes; while Peiræus and
Phalêrum, each constituting a separate deme, were also assigned to
different tribes; so that there were no local advantages either to
bestow predominance, or to create a struggle for predominance, of
one tribe over the rest.<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250"
class="fnanchor">[250]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[p.
134]</span> Each deme had its own local interests to watch over; but
the tribe was a mere aggregate of demes for political, military, and
religious purposes, with no separate hopes or fears, apart from the
whole state. Each tribe had a chapel, sacred rites and festivals,
and a common fund for such meetings, in honor of its eponymous hero,
administered by members of its own choice;<a id="FNanchor_251"
href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> and the statues of
all the ten eponymous heroes, fraternal patrons of the democracy,
were planted in the most conspicuous part of the agora of Athens.
In the future working of the Athenian government, we shall trace no
symptom of disquieting local factions,—a capital amendment, compared
with the disputes of the preceding century, and traceable, in
part, to the absence of border-relations between demes of the same
tribe.</p>

<p>The deme now became the primitive constituent element of the
commonwealth, both as to persons and as to property. It had its own
demarch, its register of enrolled citizens, its collective property,
its public meetings and religious ceremonies, its taxes levied
and administered by itself. The register of qualified citizens<a
id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a>
was kept by the demarch, and the inscription of new citizens took
place at the assembly of the demots, whose legitimate sons were
enrolled on attaining the age of eighteen, and their adopted sons
at any time when presented and sworn to by the adopting citizen.
The citizenship could only be granted by a public vote of the
people, but wealthy non-freemen were enabled sometimes to evade this
law and purchase admission upon the register of some poor deme,
probably by means of a fictitious adoption. At<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_135">[p. 135]</span> the meetings of the demots, the
register was called over, and it sometimes happened that some
names were expunged,—in which case the party thus disfranchised
had an appeal to the popular judicature.<a id="FNanchor_253"
href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> So great was the
local administrative power, however, of these demes, that they are
described as the substitute,<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254"
class="fnanchor">[254]</a> under the Kleisthenean system, for the
naukraries under the Solonian and ante-Solonian. The trittyes and
naukraries, though nominally preserved, and the latter (as some
affirm) augmented in number from forty-eight to fifty, appear
henceforward as of little public importance.</p>

<p>Kleisthenês preserved, but at the same time modified and expanded,
all the main features of Solon’s political constitution; the public
assembly, or ekklesia,—the preconsidering senate, composed of members
from all the tribes,—and the habit of annual election, as well as
annual responsibility of magistrates, by and to the ekklesia. The
full value must now have been felt of possessing such preëxisting
institutions to build upon, at a moment of perplexity and dissension.
But the Kleisthenean ekklesia acquired new strength, and almost a
new character, from the great increase of the number of citizens
qualified to attend it; while the annually-changed senate, instead
of being composed of four hundred members taken in equal proportion
from each of the old four tribes, was enlarged to five hundred,
taken equally from each of the new ten tribes. It now comes before
us, under the name of Senate of Five Hundred, as an active and
indispensable body throughout the whole Athenian democracy: and the
practice now seems to have begun (though the period of commencement
cannot be decisively proved), of determining the names of the
senators by lot. Both the senate thus constituted, and the public
assembly, were far more popular and vigorous than they had been under
the original arrangement of Solon.</p>

<p>The new constitution of the tribes, as it led to a change
in the annual senate, so it transformed, no less directly, the
military<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[p. 136]</span>
arrangements of the state, both as to soldiers and as to officers.
The citizens called upon to serve in arms were now marshalled
according to tribes,—each tribe having its own taxiarchs as officers
for the hoplites, and its own phylarch at the head of the horsemen.
Moreover, there were now created for the first time ten strategi, or
generals, one from each tribe; and two hipparchs, for the supreme
command of the horsemen. Under the prior Athenian constitution it
appears that the command of the military force had been vested in the
third archon, or polemarch, no strategi then existing; and even after
the latter had been created, under the Kleisthenean constitution,
the polemarch still retained a joint right of command along with
them,—as we are told at the battle of Marathon, where Kallimachus
the polemarch not only enjoyed an equal vote in the council of
war along with the ten strategi, but even occupied the post of
honor on the right wing.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255"
class="fnanchor">[255]</a> The ten generals, annually changed, are
thus (like the ten tribes) a fruit of the Kleisthenean constitution,
which was at the same time powerfully strengthened and protected
by such remodelling of the military force. The functions of the
generals becoming more extensive as the democracy advanced, they
seem to have acquired gradually not merely the direction of military
and naval affairs, but also that of the foreign relations of the
city generally,—while the nine archons, including the polemarch,
were by degrees lowered down from that full executive and judicial
competence which they had once enjoyed, to the simple ministry of
police and preparatory justice. Encroached upon by the strategi on
one side, they were also restricted in efficiency by the rise of the
popular dikasteries or numerous jury-courts, on the other. We may be
very sure that these popular dikasteries had not been permitted to
meet or to act under the despotism of the Peisistratids, and that
the judicial business of the city must then have been conducted
partly by the Senate of Areopagus, partly by the archons; perhaps
with a nominal responsibility of the latter at the end of their year
of office to an acquiescent ekklesia. And if we even assume it to
be true, as some writers contend, that the habit of direct popular
judicature, over and above this annual trial of responsibility,
had been partially introduced by Solon, it must have<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[p. 137]</span> been discontinued
during the long coercion exercised by the supervening dynasty. But
the outburst of popular spirit, which lent force to Kleisthenês,
doubtless carried the people into direct action as jurors in the
aggregate Heliæa, not less than as voters in the ekklesia,—and the
change was thus begun which contributed to degrade the archons from
their primitive character as judges, into the lower function of
preliminary examiners and presidents of a jury. Such convocation of
numerous juries, beginning first with the aggregate body of sworn
citizens above thirty years of age, and subsequently dividing them
into separate bodies or pannels, for trying particular causes, became
gradually more frequent and more systematized: until at length, in
the time of Periklês, it was made to carry a small pay, and stood out
as one of the most prominent features of Athenian life. We cannot
particularize the different steps whereby such final development was
attained, and the judicial competence of the archon cut down to the
mere power of inflicting a small fine; but the first steps of it are
found in the revolution of Kleisthenês, and it seems to have been
consummated by the reforms of Periklês. Of the function exercised by
the nine archons as well as by many other magistrates and official
persons at Athens, in convoking a dikastery, or jury-court, bringing
on causes for trial,—and presiding over the trial,—a function
constituting one of the marks of superior magistracy, and called the
Hegemony, or presidency of a dikastery,—I shall speak more at length
hereafter. At present, I wish merely to bring to view the increased
and increasing sphere of action on which the people entered at the
memorable turn of affairs now before us.</p>

<p>The financial affairs of the city underwent at this epoch as
complete a change as the military: in fact, the appointment of
magistrates and officers by tens, one from each tribe, seems to
have become the ordinary practice. A board of ten, called Apodektæ,
were invested with the supreme management of the exchequer, dealing
with the contractors as to those portions of the revenue which
were farmed, receiving all the taxes from the collectors, and
disbursing them under competent authority. The first nomination of
this board is expressly ascribed to Kleisthenês,<a id="FNanchor_256"
href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> as a substitute
for certain persons called Kôlakretæ, who<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_138">[p. 138]</span> had performed the same function before,
and who were now retained only for subordinate services. The duties
of the apodektæ were afterwards limited to receiving the public
income, and paying it over to the ten treasurers of the goddess
Athênê, by whom it was kept in the inner chamber of the Parthenon,
and disbursed as needed; but this more complicated arrangement cannot
be referred to Kleisthenês. From his time forward too, the Senate
of Five Hundred steps far beyond its original duty of preparing
matters for the discussion of the ekklesia: it embraces, besides, a
large circle of administrative and general superintendence, which
hardly admits of any definition. Its sittings become constant, with
the exception of special holidays, and the year is distributed into
ten portions called Prytanies,—the fifty senators of each tribe
taking by turns the duty of constant attendance during one prytany,
and receiving during that time the title of The Prytanes: the
order of precedence among the tribes in these duties was annually
determined by lot. In the ordinary Attic year of twelve lunar
months, or three hundred and fifty-four days, six of the prytanies
contained thirty-five days, four of them contained thirty-six: in
the intercalated years of thirteen months, the number of days was
thirty-eight and thirty-nine respectively. Moreover, a farther
subdivision of the prytany into five periods of seven days each,
and of the fifty tribe-senators into five bodies of ten each, was
recognized: each body of ten presided in the senate for one period
of seven days, drawing lots every day among their number for a
new chairman, called Epistatês, to whom during his day of office
were confided the keys of the acropolis and the treasury, together
with the city seal. The remaining senators, not belonging to the
prytanizing tribe, might of course attend if they chose; but the
attendance of nine among them, one from each of the remaining nine
tribes, was imperatively necessary to constitute a valid meeting, and
to insure a constant representation of the collective people.</p>

<p>During those later times known to us through the great
orators, the ekklesia, or formal assembly of the citizens, was
convoked four times regularly during each prytany, or oftener if
necessity required,—usually by the senate, though the stratêgi
had also the power of convoking it by their own authority. It
was presided over by the prytanes, and questions were put to
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[p. 139]</span> vote by
their epistatês, or chairman; but the nine representatives of the
non-prytanizing tribes were always present as a matter of course,
and seem, indeed, in the days of the orators, to have acquired to
themselves the direction of it, together with the right of putting
questions for the vote,<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257"
class="fnanchor">[257]</a>—setting aside wholly or partially the
fifty prytanes. When we carry our attention back, however, to the
state of the ekklesia, as first organized by Kleisthenês (I have
already remarked that expositors of the Athenian constitution are too
apt to neglect the distinction of times, and to suppose that what
was the practice between 400-330 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>
had been always the practice), it will appear probable that he
provided one regular meeting in each prytany, and no more; giving
to the senate and the stratêgi power of convening special meetings
if needful, but establishing one ekklesia during each prytany, or
ten in the year, as a regular necessity of state. How often the
ancient ekklesia had been convoked during the interval between Solon
and Peisistratus, we cannot exactly say,—probably but seldom during
the year. But under the Peisistratids, its convocation had dwindled
down into an inoperative formality; and the reëstablishment of it by
Kleisthenês, not merely with plenary determining powers, but also
under full notice and preparation of matters beforehand, together
with the best securities for orderly procedure, was in itself a
revolution impressive to the mind of every Athenian citizen. To
render the ekklesia efficient, it was indispensable that its meetings
should be both frequent and free. Men thus became trained to the
duty both of speakers and hearers, and each man, while he felt that
he exercised his share of influence on the decision, identified
his own safety and happiness with the vote of the majority, and
became familiarized with the notion of a sovereign authority which
he neither could nor ought to resist. This is an idea new to the
Athenian bosom; and with it came the feelings sanctifying free speech
and equal law,—words which no Athenian citizen ever afterwards heard
unmoved: together with that sentiment of the entire commonwealth
as one and indivisible, which always over<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_140">[p. 140]</span>ruled, though it did not supplant, the
local and cantonal special ties. It is not too much to say that these
patriotic and ennobling impulses were a new product in the Athenian
mind, to which nothing analogous occurs even in the time of Solon.
They were kindled in part doubtless by the strong reaction against
the Peisistratids, but still more by the fact that the opposing
leader, Kleisthenês, turned that transitory feeling to the best
possible account, and gave to it a vigorous perpetuity, as well as
a well-defined positive object, by the popular elements conspicuous
in his constitution. His name makes less figure in history than we
should expect, because he passed for the mere renovator of Solon’s
scheme of government after it had been overthrown by Peisistratus.
Probably he himself professed this object, since it would facilitate
the success of his propositions: and if we confine ourselves to the
letter of the case, the fact is in a great measure true, since the
annual senate and the ekklesia are both Solonian,—but both of them
under his reform were clothed in totally new circumstances, and
swelled into gigantic proportions. How vigorous was the burst of
Athenian enthusiasm, altering instantaneously the position of Athens
among the powers of Greece, we shall hear presently from the lips
of Herodotus, and shall find still more unequivocally marked in the
facts of his history.</p>

<p>But it was not only the people formally installed in their
ekklesia, who received from Kleisthenês the real attributes of
sovereignty,—it was by him also that the people were first called
into direct action as dikasts, or jurors. I have already remarked,
that this custom may be said, in a certain limited sense, to have
begun in the time of Solon, since that lawgiver invested the popular
assembly with the power of pronouncing the judgment of accountability
upon the archons after their year of office. Here, again, the
building, afterwards so spacious and stately, was erected on a
Solonian foundation, though it was not itself Solonian. That the
popular dikasteries, in the elaborate form in which they existed
from Periklês downward, were introduced all at once by Kleisthenês,
it is impossible to believe; yet the steps by which they were
gradually wrought out are not distinctly discoverable. It would
rather seem, that at first only the aggregate body of citizens
above thirty years of age exercised judicial<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_141">[p. 141]</span> functions, being specially convoked and
sworn to try persons accused of public crimes, and when so employed
bearing the name of the heliæa, or heliasts; private offences and
disputes between man and man being still determined by individual
magistrates in the city, and a considerable judicial power still
residing in the Senate of Areopagus. There is reason to believe that
this was the state of things established by Kleisthenês, and which
afterwards came to be altered by the greater extent of judicial
duty gradually accruing to the heliasts, so that it was necessary
to subdivide the collective heliæa. According to the subdivision,
as practised in the times best known, six thousand citizens above
thirty years of age were annually selected by lot out of the whole
number, six hundred from each of the ten tribes: five thousand of
these citizens were arranged in ten pannels or decuries of five
hundred each, the remaining one thousand being reserved to fill up
vacancies in case of death or absence among the former. The whole
six thousand took a prescribed oath, couched in very striking words,
and every man received a ticket inscribed with his own name as well
as with a letter designating his decury. When there were causes or
crimes ripe for trial, the thesmothets, or six inferior archons,
determined by lot, first, which decuries should sit, according to
the number wanted,—next, in which court, or under the presidency of
what magistrate, the decury B or E should sit, so that it could not
be known beforehand in what cause each would be judge. In the number
of persons who actually attended and sat, however, there seems to
have been much variety, and sometimes two decuries sat together.<a
id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>
The arrangement here described, we must recollect, is given to us as
belonging to those times when the dikasts received a regular pay,
after every day’s sitting; and it can hardly have long con<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[p. 142]</span>tinued without that
condition, which was not realized before the time of Periklês. Each
of these decuries sitting in judicature was called <i>The Heliæa</i>,—a
name which belongs properly to the collective assembly of the people;
this collective assembly having been itself the original judicature.
I conceive that the practice of distributing this collective
assembly, or heliæa, into sections of jurors for judicial duty,
may have begun under one form or another soon after the reform of
Kleisthenês, since the direct interference of the people in public
affairs tended more and more to increase. But it could only have
been matured by degrees into that constant and systematic service
which the pay of Periklês called forth at last in completeness. Under
the last-mentioned system the judicial competence of the archons
was annulled, and the third archon, or polemarch, withdrawn from
all military functions. Still, this had not been yet done at the
time of the battle of Marathon, in which Kallimachus the polemarch
not only commanded along with the stratêgi, but enjoyed a sort of
preëminence over them: nor had it been done during the year after
the battle of Marathon, in which Aristeidês was archon,—for the
magisterial decisions of Aristeidês formed one of the principal
foundations of his honorable surname, the Just.<a id="FNanchor_259"
href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>

<p>With this question, as to the comparative extent of judicial power
vested by Kleisthenês in the popular dikastery and the archons, are
in reality connected two others in Athenian constitutional law;
relating, first, to the admissibility of all citizens for the post
of archon,—next, to the choosing of archons by lot. It is well known
that, in the time of Periklês, the archons, and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_143">[p. 143]</span> various other individual functionaries,
had come to be chosen by lot,—moreover, all citizens were legally
admissible, and might give in their names to be drawn for by lot,
subject to what was called the dokimasy, or legal examination into
their status of citizen, and into various moral and religious
qualifications, before they took office; while at the same time the
function of the archon had become nothing higher than preliminary
examination of parties and witnesses for the dikastery, and
presidence over it when afterwards assembled, together with the
power of imposing by authority a fine of small amount upon inferior
offenders.</p>

<p>Now all these three political arrangements hang essentially
together. The great value of the lot, according to Grecian
democratical ideas, was that it equalized the chance of office
between rich and poor. But so long as the poor citizens were
legally inadmissible, choice by lot could have no recommendation
either to the rich or to the poor; in fact, it would be less
democratical than election by the general mass of citizens, because
the poor citizen would under the latter system enjoy an important
right of interference by means of his suffrage, though he could
not be elected himself.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260"
class="fnanchor">[260]</a> Again, choice by lot could<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[p. 144]</span> never under any
circumstances be applied to those posts where special competence,
and a certain measure of attributes possessed only by a few, could
not be dispensed with without obvious peril,—nor was it ever
applied, throughout the whole history of democratical Athens, to
the stratêgi, or generals, who were always elected by show of
hands of the assembled citizens. Accordingly, we may regard it as
certain that, at the time when the archons first came to be chosen
by lot, the superior and responsible duties once attached to that
office had been, or were in course of being, detached from it, and
transferred either to the popular dikasts or to the ten elected
stratêgi: so that there remained to these archons only a routine
of police and administration, important indeed to the state, yet
such as could be executed by any citizen of average probity,
diligence, and capacity. At least there was no obvious absurdity
in thinking so; and the dokimasy excluded from the office men of
notoriously discreditable life, even after they might have drawn the
successful lot. Periklês,<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261"
class="fnanchor">[261]</a> though chosen stratêgus, year after year
successively, was never archon; and it may even be doubted whether
men of first-rate talents and ambition often gave in their names
for the office. To those of smaller aspirations<a id="FNanchor_262"
href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> it was doubtless a
source of importance, but it imposed troublesome labor, gave no pay,
and entailed a certain degree of peril upon any archon who might
have given offence to pow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[p.
145]</span>erful men, when he came to pass through the trial of
accountability which followed immediately upon his year of office.
There was little to make the office acceptable either to very poor
men, or to very rich and ambitious men; and between the middling
persons who gave in their names, any one might be taken without
great practical mischief, always assuming the two guarantees of
the dokimasy before, and accountability after, office. This was
the conclusion—in my opinion a mistaken conclusion, and such as
would find no favor at present—to which the democrats of Athens
were conducted by their strenuous desire to equalize the chances of
office for rich and poor. But their sentiment seems to have been
satisfied by a partial enforcement of the lot to the choice of some
offices,—especially the archons, as the primitive chief magistrates
of the state,—without applying it to all, or to the most responsible
and difficult. Nor would they have applied it to the archons, if it
had been indispensably necessary that these magistrates should retain
their original very serious duty of judging disputes and condemning
offenders.</p>

<p>I think, therefore, that these three points: 1. The opening of the
post of archon to all citizens indiscriminately; 2. The choice of
archons by lot; 3. The diminished range of the archon’s duties and
responsibilities, through the extension of those belonging to the
popular courts of justice on the one hand and to the stratêgi on the
other—are all connected together, and must have been simultaneous,
or nearly simultaneous, in the time of introduction: the enactment
of universal admissibility to office certainly not coming after the
other two, and probably coming a little before them.</p>

<p>Now in regard to the eligibility of all Athenians indiscriminately
to the office of archon, we find a clear and positive testimony
as to the time when it was first introduced. Plutarch tells us<a
id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>
that the oligarchical,<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264"
class="fnanchor">[264]</a> but high-principled Aristeidês, was
himself the proposer of this constitutional change,—shortly
after the battle of Platæa, with the consequent expulsion of the
Persians from Greece, and the return of the refugee Athenians<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[p. 146]</span> to their ruined city.
Seldom has it happened in the history of mankind, that rich and poor
have been so completely equalized as among the population of Athens
in that memorable expatriation and heroic struggle. Nor are we at
all surprised to hear that the mass of the citizens, coming back
with freshly-kindled patriotism as well as with the consciousness
that their country had only been recovered by the equal efforts of
all, would no longer submit to be legally disqualified from any
office of state. It was on this occasion that the constitution was
first made really “common” to all, and that the archons, stratêgi,
and all functionaries, first began to be chosen from all Athenians
without any difference of legal eligibility.<a id="FNanchor_265"
href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> No mention is made
of the lot, in this important statement of Plutarch, which appears
to me every way worthy of credit, and which teaches us that, down to
the invasion of Xerxês, not only had the exclusive principle of the
Solonian law of qualification continued in force (whereby the first
three classes on the census were alone admitted to all individual
offices, and the fourth or Thêtic class excluded), but also the
archons had hitherto been elected by the citizens,—not taken by
lot.</p>

<p>Now for financial purposes, the quadruple census of Solon was
retained long after this period, even beyond the Peloponnesian war
and the oligarchy of Thirty. But we thus learn that Kleisthenês
in his constitution retained it for political purposes also, in
part at least: he recognized the exclusion of the great mass of
the citizens from all individual offices,—such as the archon, the
stratêgus, etc. In his time, probably, no complaints were raised on
the subject. His constitution gave to the collective bodies—senate,
ekklesia, and heliæa, or dikastery—a degree of power and importance
such as they had never before known or imagined: and we may well
suppose that the Athenian people of that day had no objection even
to the proclaimed system and theory of being exclusively governed
by men of wealth and station as individual magistrates,—especially
since many of the newly-enfranchised citizens had been previously
metics and slaves. Indeed, it is to be added that, even under the
full<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[p. 147]</span> democracy
of later Athens, though the people had then become passionately
attached to the theory of equal admissibility of all citizens to
office, yet, in practice, poor men seldom obtained offices which
were elected by the general vote, as will appear more fully in the
course of this history.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266"
class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p>

<p>The choice of the stratêgi remained ever afterwards upon the
footing on which Aristeidês thus placed it. But the lot for the
choice of archon must have been introduced shortly after his
proposition of universal eligibility, and in consequence too of
the same tide of democratical feeling,—introduced as a farther
corrective, because the poor citizen, though he had become eligible,
was nevertheless not elected. And at the same time, I imagine,
that elaborate distribution of the Heliæa, or aggregate body of
dikasts, or jurors, into separate pannels, or dikasteries, for the
decision of judicial matters, was first regularized. It was this
change that stole away from the archons so important a part of their
previous jurisdiction: it was this change that Periklês more fully
consummated by insuring pay to the dikasts. But the present is not
the time to enter into the modifications which Athens underwent
during the generation after the battle of Platæa. They have been
here briefly noticed for the purpose of reasoning back, in the
absence of direct evidence, to Athens as it stood in the generation
before that memorable battle, after the reform of Kleisthenês.
His reform, though highly democratical,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_148">[p. 148]</span> stopped short of the mature democracy
which prevailed from Periklês to Demosthenês, in three ways
especially, among various others; and it is therefore sometimes
considered by the later writers as an aristocratical constitution:<a
id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> 1.
It still recognized the archons as judges to a considerable extent,
and the third archon, or polemarch, as joint military commander
along with the stratêgi. 2. It retained them as elected annually
by the body of citizens, not as chosen by lot.<a id="FNanchor_268"
href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> 3. It still
excluded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[p. 149]</span> the
fourth class of the Solonian census from all individual office,
the archonship among the rest. The Solonian law of exclusion,
however, though retained in principle, was mitigated in practice
thus far,—that whereas Solon had rendered none but members of the
highest class on the census (the Pentakosiomedimni) eligible to the
archonship, Kleisthenês opened that dignity to all the first three
classes, shutting out only the fourth. That he did this may be
inferred from the fact that Aristeidês, assuredly not a rich man,
became archon.</p>

<p>I am also inclined to believe that the Senate of Five Hundred, as
constituted by Kleisthenês, was taken, not by election, but by lot,
from the ten tribes,—and that every citizen became eligible to it.
Election for this purpose—that is, the privilege of annually electing
a batch of fifty senators, all at once, by each tribe—would probably
be thought more troublesome than valuable; nor do we hear of separate
meetings of each tribe for purposes of election. Moreover, the office
of senator was a collective, not an individual office; the shock,
therefore, to the feelings of semi-democratized Athens, from the
unpleasant idea of a poor man sitting among the fifty prytanes, would
be less than if they conceived him as polemarch at the head of the
right wing of the army, or as an archon administering justice.</p>

<p>A farther difference between the constitution of Solon and that
of Kleisthenês is to be found in the position of the Senate of
Areopagus. Under the former, that senate had been the principal
body in the state, and he had even enlarged its powers; under the
latter, it must have been treated at first as an enemy, and kept
down. For as it was composed only of all the past archons, and as,
during the preceding thirty years, every archon had been a creature
of the Peisistratids, the Areopagites collectively must have been
both hostile and odious to Kleisthenês and his partisans,—perhaps a
fraction of its members might even retire into exile with Hippias.
Its influence must have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[p.
150]</span> sensibly lessened by the change of party, until it
came to be gradually filled by fresh archons springing from the
bosom of the Kleisthenean constitution. But during this important
interval, the new-modelled Senate of Five Hundred, and the popular
assembly, stepped into that ascendency which they never afterwards
lost. From the time of Kleisthenês forward, the Areopagites cease to
be the chief and prominent power in the state: yet they are still
considerable; and when the second fill of the democratical tide took
place, after the battle of Platæa, they became the focus of that
which was then considered as the party of oligarchical resistance. I
have already remarked that the archons, during the intermediate time
(about 509-477 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), were all elected
by the ekklesia, not chosen by lot,—and that the fourth (or poorest
and most numerous) class on the census were by law then ineligible;
while election at Athens, even when every citizen without exception
was an elector and eligible, had a natural tendency to fall upon
men of wealth and station. We thus see how it happened that the
past archons, when united in the Senate of Areopagus, infused into
that body the sympathies, prejudices, and interests of the richer
classes. It was this which brought them into conflict with the more
democratical party headed by Periklês and Ephialtês, in times when
portions of the Kleisthenean constitution had come to be discredited
as too much imbued with oligarchy.</p>

<p>One other remarkable institution, distinctly ascribed to
Kleisthenês, yet remains to be noticed,—the Ostracism; upon
which I have already made some remarks,<a id="FNanchor_269"
href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> in touching upon the
memorable Solonian proclamation against neutrality in a sedition. It
is hardly too much to say that, without this protective process, none
of the other institutions would have reached maturity.</p>

<p>By the ostracism, a citizen was banished without special
accusation, trial, or defence, for a term of ten years,—subsequently
diminished to five. His property was not taken away, nor his
reputation tainted; so that the penalty consisted solely in the
banishment from his native city to some other Greek city. As to
reputation, the ostracism was a compliment rather than otherwise;<a
id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a>
and so it was vividly felt to be, when, about ninety years<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[p. 151]</span> after Kleisthenês, the
conspiracy between Nikias and Alkibiadês fixed it upon Hyperbolus.
The two former had both recommended the taking of an ostracizing
vote, each hoping to cause the banishment of the other; but before
the day arrived, they accommodated the difference. To fire off the
safety-gun of the republic against a person so little dangerous
as Hyperbolus, was denounced as the prostitution of a great
political ceremony: “it was not against such men as him (said the
comic writer, Plato),<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271"
class="fnanchor">[271]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[p.
152]</span> that the oyster-shell (or potsherd) was intended to be
used.” The process of ostracism was carried into effect by writing
upon a shell, or potsherd, the name of the person whom a citizen
thought it prudent for a time to banish; which shell, when deposited
in the proper vessel, counted for a vote towards the sentence.</p>

<p>I have already observed that all the governments of the Grecian
cities, when we compare them with that idea which a modern reader is
apt to conceive of the measure of force belonging to a government,
were essentially weak, the good as well as the bad,—the democratical,
the oligarchical, and the despotic. The force in the hands of any
government, to cope with conspirators or mutineers, was extremely
small, with the single exception of a despot surrounded by his
mercenary troop; so that no tolerably sustained conspiracy or usurper
could be put down except by the direct aid of the people in support
of the government; which amounted to a dissolution, for the time,
of constitutional authority, and was pregnant with reactionary
consequences such as no man could foresee. To prevent powerful men
from attempting usurpation was, therefore, of the greatest possible
moment; and a despot or an oligarchy might exercise preventive
means at pleasure,<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272"
class="fnanchor">[272]</a> much sharper than the ostracism, such
as the assassination of Kimon, mentioned in my last chapter, as
directed by the Peisistratids. At the very least, they might
send away any one, from whom they apprehended attack or danger,
without incurring even so much as the imputation of severity. But
in a democracy, where arbitrary action of the magistrate was the
thing of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[p. 153]</span> all
others most dreaded, and where fixed laws, with trial and defence
as preliminaries to punishment, were conceived by the ordinary
citizen as the guarantees of his personal security and as the
pride of his social condition,—the creation of such an exceptional
power presented serious difficulty. If we transport ourselves to
the times of Kleisthenês, immediately after the expulsion of the
Peisistratids, when the working of the democratical machinery was
as yet untried, we shall find this difficulty at its maximum; but
we shall also find the necessity of vesting such a power somewhere
absolutely imperative. For the great Athenian nobles had yet to
learn the lesson of respect for any constitution; their past history
had exhibited continual struggles between the armed factions of
Megaklês, Lykurgus, and Peisistratus, put down after a time by the
superior force and alliances of the latter. And though Kleisthenês,
the son of Megaklês, might be firmly disposed to renounce the
example of his father, and to act as the faithful citizen of a
fixed constitution,—he would know but too well that the sons of his
father’s companions and rivals would follow out ambitious purposes
without any regard to the limits imposed by law, if ever they
acquired sufficient partisans to present a fair prospect of success.
Moreover, when any two candidates for power, with such reckless
dispositions, came into a bitter personal rivalry, the motives to
each of them, arising as well out of fear as out of ambition, to put
down his opponent at any cost to the constitution, might well become
irresistible, unless some impartial and discerning interference could
arrest the strife in time. “If the Athenians were wise (Aristeidês
is reported to have said,<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273"
class="fnanchor">[273]</a> in the height and peril of his
parliamentary struggle with Themistoklês), they would cast both
Themistoklês and me into the barathrum.”<a id="FNanchor_274"
href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> And whoever<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[p. 154]</span> reads the sad narrative
of the Korkyræan sedition, in the third book of Thucydidês, together
with the reflections of the historian upon it,<a id="FNanchor_275"
href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> will trace the
gradual exasperation of these party feuds, beginning even under
democratical forms, until at length they break down the barriers of
public as well as of private morality.</p>

<p>Against this chance of internal assailants Kleisthenês had to
protect the democratical constitution,—first, by throwing impediments
in their way and rendering it difficult for them to procure the
requisite support; next, by eliminating them before any violent
projects were ripe for execution. To do either the one or the other,
it was necessary to provide such a constitution as would not only
conciliate the good-will, but kindle the passionate attachment,
of the mass of citizens, insomuch that not even any considerable
minority should be deliberately inclined to alter it by force. It was
necessary to create in the multitude, and through them to force upon
the leading ambitious men, that rare and difficult sentiment which
we may term a constitutional morality; a paramount reverence for the
forms of the constitution, enforcing obedience to the authorities
acting under and within those forms, yet combined with the habit of
open speech, of action subject only to definite legal control, and
unrestrained censure of those very authorities as to all their public
acts,—combined too with a perfect confidence in the bosom of every
citizen, amidst the bitterness of party contest, that the forms of
the constitution will be not less sacred in the eyes of his opponents
than in his own. This coexistence of freedom and self-imposed
restraint,—of obedience to authority with unmeasured censure of the
persons exercising it,—may be found in the aristocracy of England
(since about 1688) as well as in the democracy of the American United
States: and because we are familiar with it, we are apt to suppose
it a natural sentiment; though there seem to be few sentiments more
difficult to establish and diffuse among a community, judging by the
experience of history. We may see how imperfectly it exists at this
day in the Swiss cantons; and the many violences of the first French
revolution illustrate, among various other lessons, the fatal effects
arising from its absence, even among a people high in the scale of
intelligence. Yet the dif<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[p.
155]</span>fusion of such constitutional morality, not merely among
the majority of any community, but throughout the whole, is the
indispensable condition of a government at once free and peaceable;
since even any powerful and obstinate minority may render the working
of free institutions impracticable, without being strong enough to
conquer ascendency for themselves. Nothing less than unanimity, or
so overwhelming a majority as to be tantamount to unanimity, on the
cardinal point of respecting constitutional forms, even by those who
do not wholly approve of them, can render the excitement of political
passion bloodless, and yet expose all the authorities in the state to
the full license of pacific criticism.</p>

<p>At the epoch of Kleisthenês, which by a remarkable coincidence
is the same as that of the regifuge at Rome, such constitutional
morality, if it existed anywhere else, had certainly no place at
Athens; and the first creation of it in any particular society
must be esteemed an interesting historical fact. By the spirit of
his reforms,—equal, popular, and comprehensive, far beyond the
previous experience of Athenians,—he secured the hearty attachment
of the body of citizens; but from the first generation of leading
men, under the nascent democracy, and with such precedents as they
had to look back upon, no self-imposed limits to ambition could be
expected: and the problem required was to eliminate beforehand any
one about to transgress these limits, so as to escape the necessity
of putting him down afterwards, with all that bloodshed and reaction,
in the midst of which the free working of the constitution would be
suspended at least, if not irrevocably extinguished. To acquire such
influence as would render him dangerous under democratical forms,
a man must stand in evidence before the public, so as to afford
some reasonable means of judging of his character and purposes;
and the security which Kleisthenês provided, was, to call in the
positive judgment of the citizens respecting his future promise
purely and simply, so that they might not remain too long neutral
between two formidable political rivals,—pursuant in a certain way
to the Solonian proclamation against neutrality in a sedition, as I
have already remarked in a former chapter. He incorporated in the
constitution itself the principle of <i>privilegium</i> (to employ the
Roman phrase, which signifies, not a peculiar<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_156">[p. 156]</span> favor granted to any one, but a
peculiar inconvenience imposed), yet only under circumstances solemn
and well defined, with full notice and discussion beforehand, and
by the positive secret vote of a large proportion of the citizens.
“No law shall be made against any single citizen, without the same
being made against <i>all</i> Athenian citizens; unless it shall so seem
good to six thousand citizens voting secretly.”<a id="FNanchor_276"
href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> Such was that
general principle of the constitution, under which the ostracism
was a particular case. Before the vote of ostracism could be taken,
a case was to be made out in the senate and the public assembly
to justify it. In the sixth prytany of the year, these two bodies
debated and determined whether the state of the republic was menacing
enough to call for such an exceptional measure.<a id="FNanchor_277"
href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> If they decided in
the affirmative, a day was named, the agora was railed round, with
ten entrances left for the citizens of each tribe, and ten separate
casks or vessels for depositing the suffrages, which consisted of a
shell, or a potsherd, with the name of the person written on it whom
each citizen designed to banish. At the end of the day, the number
of votes was summed up, and if six thousand votes were found to
have been given against any one person, that person was ostracized;
if not, the ceremony ended in nothing.<a id="FNanchor_278"
href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> Ten days were allowed
to him for settling his af<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[p.
157]</span>fairs, after which he was required to depart from Attica
for ten years, but retained his property, and suffered no other
penalty.</p>

<p>It was not the maxim at Athens to escape the errors of the
people, by calling in the different errors, and the sinister
interest besides, of an extra-popular or privileged few; nor was
any third course open, since the principles of representative
government were not understood, nor indeed conveniently applicable
to very small communities. Beyond the judgment of the people—so
the Athenians felt—there was no appeal; and their grand study was
to surround the delivery of that judgment with the best securities
for rectitude and the best preservatives against haste, passion, or
private corruption. Whatever measure of good government could not
be obtained in that way, could not, in their opinion, be obtained
at all. I shall illustrate the Athenian proceedings on this head
more fully when I come to speak of the working of their mature
democracy: meanwhile, in respect to this grand protection of the
nascent democracy,—the vote of ostracism,—it will be found that
the securities devised by Kleisthenês, for making the sentence
effectual against the really dangerous man, and against no one else,
display not less foresight than patriotism. The main object was, to
render the voting an expression of deliberate public feeling, as
distinguished from mere factious antipathy: the large minimum of
votes required, one-fourth of the entire citizen population, went
far to insure this effect,—the more so, since each vote, taken as it
was in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[p. 158]</span> secret
manner, counted unequivocally for the expression of a genuine and
independent sentiment, and could neither be coerced nor bought.
Then again, Kleisthenês did not permit the process of ostracizing
to be opened against any one citizen exclusively. If opened at all,
every one without exception was exposed to the sentence; so that the
friends of Themistoklês could not invoke it against Aristeidês,<a
id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a>
nor those of the latter against the former, without exposing their
own leader to the same chance of exile. It was not likely to be
invoked at all, therefore, until exasperation had proceeded so far
as to render both parties insensible to this chance,—the precise
index of that growing internecive hostility, which the ostracism
prevented from coming to a head. Nor could it even then be ratified,
unless a case was shown to convince the more neutral portion of the
senate and the ekklesia: moreover, after all, the ekklesia did not
itself ostracize, but a future day was named, and the whole body of
the citizens were solemnly invited to vote. It was in this way that
security was taken not only for making the ostracism effectual in
protecting the constitution, but to hinder it from being employed
for any other purpose. And we must recollect that it exercised
its tutelary influence, not merely on those occasions when it was
actually employed, but by the mere knowledge that it might be
employed, and by the restraining effect which that knowledge produced
on the conduct of the great men. Again, the ostracism, though
essentially of an exceptional nature, was yet an exception sanctified
and limited by the constitution itself; so that the citizen, in
giving his ostracizing vote, did not in any way depart from the
constitution or lose his reverence for it. The issue placed before
him—“Is there any man whom you think vitally dangerous to the state?
if so, whom?”—though vague, was yet raised directly and legally. Had
there been no ostracism, it might probably have been raised both
indirectly and illegally, on the occasion of some special imputed
crime of a suspected political leader, when accused before a court
of justice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[p. 159]</span> —a
perversion, involving all the mischief of the ostracism, without its
protective benefits.</p>

<p>Care was taken to divest the ostracism of all painful consequence
except what was inseparable from exile; and this is not one of
the least proofs of the wisdom with which it was devised. Most
certainly, it never deprived the public of candidates for political
influence: and when we consider the small amount of individual evil
which it inflicted,—evil too diminished, in the cases of Kimon
and Aristeidês, by a reactionary sentiment which augmented their
subsequent popularity after return,—two remarks will be quite
sufficient to offer in the way of justification. First, it completely
produced its intended effect; for the democracy grew up from infancy
to manhood without a single attempt to overthrow it by force,<a
id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>—a
result, upon which no reflecting contemporary of Kleisthenês
could have ventured to calculate. Next, through such tranquil
working of the democratical forms, a constitutional morality quite
sufficiently complete was produced among the leading Athenians,
to enable the people after a certain time to dispense with that
exceptional security which the ostracism offered.<a id="FNanchor_281"
href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> To the nascent
democ<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[p. 160]</span>racy,
it was absolutely indispensable; to the growing yet militant
democracy, it was salutary; but the full-grown democracy both could
and did stand without it. The ostracism passed upon Hyperbolus,
about ninety years after Kleisthenês, was the last occasion of its
employment. And even this can hardly be considered as a serious
instance: it was a trick concerted between two distinguished
Athenians (Nikias and Alkibiadês), to turn to their own political
account a process already coming to be antiquated. Nor would
such a manœuvre have been possible, if the contemporary Athenian
citizens had been penetrated with the same, serious feeling of the
value of ostracism as a safeguard of democracy, as had been once
entertained by their fathers and grandfathers. Between Kleisthenês
and Hyperbolus, we hear of about ten different persons as having
been banished by ostracism. First of all, Hipparchus of the deme
Cholargus, the son of Charmus, a relative of the recently-expelled
Peisistratid despots;<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282"
class="fnanchor">[282]</a> then Aristeidês, Themistoklês, Kimon,
and Thucydidês son of Melêsias, all of them renowned political
leaders; also Alkibiadês and Megaklês (the paternal and maternal
grandfathers of the distinguished Alkibiadês), and Kallias,
belonging to another eminent family at Athens;<a id="FNanchor_283"
href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> lastly, Damôn, the
preceptor of Periklês in poetry and music, and eminent for his
acquisitions in philosophy.<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284"
class="fnanchor">[284]</a> In this last case comes out the vulgar
side of humanity, aristocratical as well as democratical; for with
both, the process of philosophy and the persons of philosophers are
wont to be alike unpopular. Even Kleisthenês himself is said to have
been ostracized under his own law, and Xanthippus; but both upon
authority too weak to trust.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285"
class="fnanchor">[285]</a> Miltiadês was not ostracized at all, but
tried and punished for misconduct in his command.</p>

<p>I should hardly have said so much about this memorable
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[p. 161]</span> peculiar
institution of Kleisthenês, if the erroneous accusations against
the Athenian democracy,—of envy, injustice, and ill-treatment of
their superior men, had not been greatly founded upon it, and if
such criticisms had not passed from ancient times to modern with
little examination. In monarchical governments, a pretender to the
throne, numbering a certain amount of supporters, is, as a matter
of course, excluded from the country. The duke of Bordeaux cannot
now reside in France,—nor could Napoleon after 1815,—nor Charles
Edward in England during the last century. No man treats this as any
extravagant injustice, yet it is the parallel of the ostracism,—with
a stronger case in favor of the latter, inasmuch as the change from
one regal dynasty to another does not of necessity overthrow all
the collateral institutions and securities of the country. Plutarch
has affirmed that the ostracism arose from the envy and jealousy
inherent in a democracy,<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286"
class="fnanchor">[286]</a> and not from justifiable fears,—an
observation often repeated, yet not the less demonstrably untrue.
Not merely because ostracism so worked as often to increase the
influence of that political leader whose rival it removed,—but
still more, because, if the fact had been as Plutarch says, this
institution would have continued as long as the democracy; whereas
it finished with the banishment of Hyperbolus, at a period when
the government was more decisively democratical than it had been
in the time of Kleisthenês. It was, in truth, a product altogether
of fear and insecurity,<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287"
class="fnanchor">[287]</a> on the part both of the democracy and
its best friends,—fear perfectly well-grounded, and only appearing
needless because the precautions taken prevented attack. So soon
as the diffusion of a constitutional morality had placed the mass
of the citizens above all serious fear of an aggressive usurper
the ostracism was discontinued. And doubtless the feeling, that it
might safely be dispensed with, must have been strengthened by the
long ascendency of Periklês,—by the spectacle of the great<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[p. 162]</span>est statesman whom
Athens ever produced, acting steadily within the limits of the
constitution; as well as by the ill-success of his two opponents,
Kimon and Thucydidês,—aided by numerous partisans and by the great
comic writers, at a period when comedy was a power in the state
such as it has never been before or since,—in their attempts to get
him ostracized. They succeeded in fanning up the ordinary antipathy
of the citizens towards philosophers, so far as to procure the
ostracism of his friend and teacher Damôn: but Periklês himself, to
repeat the complaint of his bitter enemy, the comic poet Kratinus,<a
id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a>
“was out of the reach of the oyster-shell.” If Periklês was not
conceived to be dangerous to the constitution, none of his successors
were at all likely to be so regarded. Damôn and Hyperbolus were
the two last persons ostracized: both of them were cases, and the
only cases, of an unequivocal abuse of the institution, because,
whatever the grounds of displeasure against them may have been,
it is impossible to conceive either of them as menacing to the
state,—whereas all the other known sufferers were men of such
position and power, that the six or eight thousand citizens who
inscribed each name on the shell, or at least a large proportion
of them, may well have done so under the most conscientious belief
that they were guarding the constitution against real danger. Such a
change, in the character of the persons ostracized, plainly evinces
that the ostracism had become dissevered from that genuine patriotic
prudence which originally rendered it both legitimate and popular. It
had served for two generations an inestimable tutelary purpose,—it
lived to be twice dishonored,—and then passed, by universal
acquiescence, into matter of history.</p>

<p>A process analogous to the ostracism subsisted at Argos,<a
id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> at
Syracuse, and in some other Grecian democracies. Aristotle states
that it was abused for factious purposes: and at Syracuse,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[p. 163]</span> where it was introduced
after the expulsion of the Gelonian dynasty, Diodorus affirms that
it was so unjustly and profusely applied, as to deter persons of
wealth and station from taking any part in public affairs; for which
reason it was speedily discontinued. We have no particulars to enable
us to appreciate this general statement. But we cannot safely infer
that because the ostracism worked on the whole well at Athens, it
must necessarily have worked well in other states,—the more so, as
we do not know whether it was surrounded with the same precautionary
formalities, nor whether it even required the same large minimum of
votes to make it effective. This latter guarantee, so valuable in
regard to an institution essentially easy to abuse, is not noticed
by Diodorus in his brief account of the Petalism,—so the process was
denominated at Syracuse.<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290"
class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<p>Such was the first Athenian democracy, engendered as well by
the reaction against Hippias and his dynasty as by the memorable
partnership, whether spontaneous or compulsory, between Kleisthenês
and the unfranchised multitude. It is to be distinguished, both
from the mitigated oligarchy established by Solon before, and from
the full-grown and symmetrical democracy which prevailed afterwards
from the beginning of the Peloponnesian war towards the close of the
career of Periklês. It was, indeed, a striking revolution, impressed
upon the citizen not less by the sentiments to which it appealed
than by the visible change which it made in political and social
life. He saw himself marshalled in the ranks of hoplites, alongside
of new companions in arms,—he was enrolled in a new register, and
his property in a new schedule, in his deme and by his demarch, an
officer before unknown,—he found the year distributed afresh, for
all legal purposes, into ten parts bearing the name of prytanies,
each marked by a solemn and free-spoken ekklesia, at which he had
a right to be present,—that ekklesia was convoked and presided by
senators called prytanes, members of a senate novel both as to number
and distribution,—his political duties were now performed as member
of a tribe, designated by a name not before<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_164">[p. 164]</span> pronounced in common Attic life,
connected with one of ten heroes whose statues he now for the first
time saw in the agora, and associating him with fellow-tribemen
from all parts of Attica. All these and many others were sensible
novelties, felt in the daily proceedings of the citizen. But the
great novelty of all was, the authentic recognition of the ten new
tribes as a sovereign dêmos, or people, apart from all specialties
of phratric or gentile origin, with free speech and equal law;
retaining no distinction except the four classes of the Solonian
property-schedule with their gradations of eligibility. To a
considerable proportion of citizens this great novelty was still
farther endeared by the fact that it had raised them out of the
degraded position of metics and slaves; and to the large majority of
all the citizens, it furnished a splendid political idea, profoundly
impressive to the Greek mind,—capable of calling forth the most
ardent attachment as well as the most devoted sense of active
obligation and obedience. We have now to see how their newly-created
patriotism manifested itself.</p>

<p>Kleisthenês and his new constitution carried with them so
completely the popular favor, that Isagoras had no other way of
opposing it except by calling in the interference of Kleomenês and
the Lacedæmonians. Kleomenês listened the more readily to this call,
as he was reported to have been on an intimate footing with the wife
of Isagoras. He prepared to come to Athens; but his first aim was
to deprive the democracy of its great leader Kleisthenês, who, as
belonging to the Alkmæônid family, was supposed to be tainted with
the inherited sin of his great-grandfather Megaklês, the destroyer
of the usurper Kylôn. Kleomenês sent a herald to Athens, demanding
the expulsion “of the accursed,”—so this family were called by their
enemies, and so they continued to be called eighty years afterwards,
when the same manœuvre was practised by the Lacedæmonians of that
day against Periklês. This requisition had been recommended by
Isagoras, and was so well-timed that Kleisthenês, not venturing to
disobey it, retired voluntarily, so that Kleomenês, though arriving
at Athens only with a small force, found himself master of the city.
At the instigation of Isagoras, he sent into exile seven hundred
families, selected from the chief partisans of Kleisthenês: his next
attempt was to dissolve the new Senate of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_165">[p. 165]</span> Five Hundred and place the whole
government in the hands of three hundred adherents of the chief
whose cause he espoused. But now was seen the spirit infused into
the people by their new constitution. At the time of the first
usurpation of Peisistratus, the Senate of that day had not only not
resisted, but even lent themselves to the scheme. But the new Senate
of Kleisthenês resolutely refused to submit to dissolution, and the
citizens manifested themselves in a way at once so hostile and so
determined, that Kleomenês and Isagoras were altogether baffled.
They were compelled to retire into the acropolis and stand upon the
defensive; and this symptom of weakness was the signal for a general
rising of the Athenians, who besieged the Spartan king on the holy
rock. He had evidently come without any expectation of finding, or
any means of overpowering, resistance; for at the end of two days
his provisions were exhausted, and he was forced to capitulate. He
and his Lacedæmonians, as well as Isagoras, were allowed to retire
to Sparta; but the Athenians of the party captured along with him
were imprisoned, condemned,<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291"
class="fnanchor">[291]</a> and executed by the people.</p>

<p>Kleisthenês, with the seven hundred exiled families, was
immediately recalled, and his new constitution materially
strengthened by this first success. Yet the prospect of renewed
Spartan attack was sufficiently serious to induce him to send
envoys to Artaphernês, the Persian satrap at Sardis, soliciting
the admission of Athens into the Persian alliance: he probably
feared the intrigues of the expelled Hippias in the same quarter.
Artaphernês, having first informed himself who the Athenians were,
and where they dwelt,—replied that, if they chose to send earth
and water to the king of Persia, they might be received as allies,
but upon no other condition. Such were the feelings of alarm under
which the envoys had quitted Athens, that they went the length of
promising this unqualified token of submission. But their countrymen,
on their return, disavowed them with scorn and indignation.<a
id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>It was at this time that the first connection began between
Athens and the little Bœotian town of Platæa, situated on the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[p. 166]</span> northern slope of the
range of Kithæron, between that mountain and the river Asôpus,—on
the road from Athens to Thebes; and it is upon this first occasion
that we become acquainted with the Bœotians and their polities. In
one of my preceding volumes,<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293"
class="fnanchor">[293]</a> the Bœotian federation has already been
briefly described, as composed of some twelve or thirteen autonomous
towns under the headship of Thebes, which was, or professed to have
been, their mother-city. Platæa had been, so the Thebans affirmed,
their latest foundation;<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294"
class="fnanchor">[294]</a> it was ill-used by them, and discontented
with the alliance. Accordingly, as Kleomenês was on his way back
from Athens, the Platæans took the opportunity of addressing
themselves to him, craved the protection of Sparta against Thebes,
and surrendered their town and territory without reserve. The
Spartan king, having no motive to undertake a trust which promised
nothing but trouble, advised them to solicit the protection of
Athens, as nearer and more accessible for them in case of need.
He foresaw that this would embroil the Athenians with Bœotia; and
such anticipation was in fact his chief motive for giving the
advice, which the Platæans followed. Selecting an occasion of public
sacrifice at Athens, they dispatched thither envoys, who sat down
as suppliants at the altar, surrendered their town to Athens, and
implored protection against Thebes. Such an appeal was not to be
resisted, and protection was promised; it was soon needed, for the
Thebans invaded the Platæan territory, and an Athenian force marched
to defend it. Battle was about to be joined, when the Corinthians
interposed with their mediation, which was accepted by both parties.
They decided altogether in favor of Platæa, pronouncing that the
Thebans had no right to employ force against any seceding member of
the Bœotian federation.<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295"
class="fnanchor">[295]</a> But the Thebans, finding the decision
against them, refused to abide by it, and, attacking the Athenians on
their return, sustained a complete defeat: the latter avenged this
breach of faith by joining to Platæa the portion of Theban territory
south of the Asôpus, and making that river the limit between<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[p. 167]</span> the two. By such
success, however, the Athenians gained nothing, except the enmity
of Bœotia,—as Kleomenês had foreseen. Their alliance with Platæa,
long continued, and presenting in the course of this history several
incidents touching to our sympathies, will be found, if we except
one splendid occasion,<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296"
class="fnanchor">[296]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[p.
168]</span> productive only of burden to the one party, yet
insufficient as a protection to the other.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Kleomenês had returned to Sparta full of resentment
against the Athenians, and resolved on punishing them, as well as on
establishing his friend Isagoras as despot over them. Having been
taught, however, by humiliating experience, that this was no easy
achievement, he would not make the attempt, without having assembled
a considerable force; he summoned allies from all the various states
of Peloponnesus, yet without venturing to inform them what he was
about to undertake. He at the same time concerted measures with the
Bœotians, and with the Chalkidians of Eubœa, for a simultaneous
invasion of Attica on all sides. It appears that he had greater
confidence in their hostile dispositions towards Athens than in those
of the Peloponnesians, for he was not afraid to acquaint them with
his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[p. 169]</span> design,—and
probably the Bœotians were incensed with the recent interference of
Athens in the affair of Platæa. As soon as these preparations were
completed, the two kings of Sparta, Kleomenês and Demaratus, put
themselves at the head of the united Peloponnesian force, marched
into Attica, and advanced as far as Eleusis on the way to Athens. But
when the allies came to know the purpose for which they were to be
employed, a spirit of dissatisfaction manifested itself among them.
They had no unfriendly sentiment towards Athens; and the Corinthians
especially, favorably disposed rather than otherwise towards that
city, resolved to proceed no farther, withdrew their contingent
from the camp, and returned home. At the same time, king Demaratus,
either sharing in the general dissatisfaction, or moved by some
grudge against his colleague which had not before manifested itself,
renounced the undertaking also. And these two examples, operating
upon the preëxisting sentiment of the allies generally, caused the
whole camp to break up and return home without striking a blow.<a
id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p>We may here remark that this is the first instance known in
which Sparta appears in act as recognized head of an obligatory
Peloponnesian alliance,<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298"
class="fnanchor">[298]</a> summoning contingents from the cities to
be placed under the command of her king. Her headship, previously
recognized in theory, passes now into act, but in an unsatisfactory
manner, so as to prove the necessity of precaution and concert
beforehand,—which will be found not long wanting.</p>

<p>Pursuant to the scheme concerted, the Bœotians and Chalkidians
attacked Attica at the same time that Kleomenês entered it. The
former seized Œnoê and Hysiæ, the frontier demes of Attica on the
side towards Platæa, while the latter assailed the north-eastern
frontier, which faces Eubœa. Invaded on three sides, the Athenians
were in serious danger, and were compelled to concentrate all their
forces at Eleusis against Kleomenês, leaving the Bœotians and
Chalkidians unopposed. But the unexpected breaking up of the invading
army from Peloponnesus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[p.
170]</span> proved their rescue, and enabled them to turn the whole
of their attention to the other frontier. They marched into Bœotia to
the strait called Euripus, which separates it from Eubœa, intending
to prevent the junction of the Bœotians and Chalkidians, and to
attack the latter first apart. But the arrival of the Bœotians
caused an alteration in their scheme; they attacked the Bœotians
first, and gained a victory of the most complete character,—killing
a large number, and capturing seven hundred prisoners. On the very
same day they crossed over to Eubœa, attacked the Chalkidians, and
gained another victory so decisive that it at once terminated the
war. Many Chalkidians were taken, as well as Bœotians, and conveyed
in chains to Athens, where after a certain detention they were at
last ransomed for two minæ per man; and the tenth of the sum thus
raised was employed in the fabrication of a chariot and four horses
in bronze, which was placed in the acropolis to commemorate the
victory. Herodotus saw this trophy when he was at Athens. He saw
too, what was a still more speaking trophy, the actual chains in
which the prisoners had been fettered, exhibiting in their appearance
the damage undergone when the acropolis was burnt by Xerxês: an
inscription of four lines described the offerings and recorded
the victory out of which they had sprung.<a id="FNanchor_299"
href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<p>Another consequence of some moment arose out of this victory.
The Athenians planted a body of four thousand of their citizens as
klêruchs (lot-holders) or settlers upon the lands of the wealthy
Chalkidian oligarchy called the Hippobotæ,—proprietors probably in
the fertile plain of Lêlantum, between Chalkis and Eretria. This
is a system which we shall find hereafter extensively followed
out by the Athenians in the days of their power; partly with the
view of providing for their poorer citizens,—partly to serve as
garrison among a population either hostile or of doubtful fidelity.
These Attic klêruchs (I can find no other name by which to speak
of them) did not lose their birthright as Athenian citizens: they
were not colonists in the Grecian sense, and they are known by a
totally different name,—but they corresponded very nearly to the
colonies formally planted out on the conquered lands by Rome. The
increase of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[p. 171]</span> the
poorer population was always more or less painfully felt in every
Grecian city. For though the aggregate population never seems to
have increased very fast, yet the multiplication of children in
poor families caused the subdivision of the smaller lots of land,
until at last they became insufficient for a maintenance; and the
persons thus impoverished found it difficult to obtain subsistence
in other ways, more especially as the labor for the richer classes
was so much performed by imported slaves. Doubtless some families
possessed of landed property became extinct; but this did not at
all benefit the smaller and poorer proprietors; for the lands thus
rendered vacant passed, not to them, but by inheritance, or bequest,
or intermarriage, to other proprietors, for the most part in easy
circumstances,—since one opulent family usually intermarried with
another. I shall enter more fully at a future opportunity into this
question,—the great and serious problem of population, as it affected
the Greek communities generally, and as it was dealt with in theory
by the powerful minds of Plato and Aristotle. At present it is
sufficient to notice that the numerous klêruchies sent out by Athens,
of which this to Eubœa was the first, arose in a great measure out of
the multiplication of the poorer population, which her extended power
was employed in providing for. Her subsequent proceedings with a view
to the same object will not be always found so justifiable as this
now before us, which grew naturally, according to the ideas of the
time, out of her success against the Chalkidians.</p>

<p>The war between Athens, however, and Thebes with her Bœotian
allies, still continued, to the great and repeated disadvantage
of the latter, until at length the Thebans in despair sent to ask
advice of the Delphian oracle, and were directed to “solicit aid from
those nearest to them.”<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300"
class="fnanchor">[300]</a> “How (they replied) are we to obey? Our
nearest neighbors, of Tanagra, Korôneia, and Thespiæ, are now, and
have been from the beginning, lending us all the aid in their power.”
An ingenious Theban, however, coming to the relief of his perplexed
fellow-citizens, dived into the depths of legend and brought up a
happy meaning. “Those nearest to us (he said) are the inhabitants
of Ægina: for Thêbê (the eponym of Thebes) and Ægina (the eponym of
that island)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[p. 172]</span> were
both sisters, daughters of Asôpus: let us send to crave assistance
from the Æginetans.” If his subtle interpretation (founded upon
their descent from the same legendary progenitors) did not at once
convince all who heard it, at least no one had any better to suggest;
and envoys were at once sent to the Æginetans,—who, in reply to
a petition founded on legendary claims, sent to the help of the
Thebans a reinforcement of legendary, but venerated, auxiliaries,—the
Æakid heroes. We are left to suppose that their effigies are here
meant. It was in vain, however, that the glory and the supposed
presence of the Æakids Telamôn and Pêleus were introduced into the
Theban camp. Victory still continued on the side of Athens; and the
discouraged Thebans again sent to Ægina, restoring the heroes,<a
id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>
and praying for aid of a character more human and positive. Their
request was granted, and the Æginetans commenced war against Athens
without even the decent preliminary of a herald and declaration.<a
id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<p>This remarkable embassy first brings us into acquaintance with the
Dorians of Ægina,—oligarchical, wealthy, commercial, and powerful at
sea, even in the earliest days; more analogous to Corinth than to
any of the other cities called Dorian. The hos<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_173">[p. 173]</span>tility which they now began without
provocation against Athens,—repressed by Sparta at the critical
moment of the battle of Marathon,—then again breaking out,—and hushed
for a while by the common dangers of the Persian invasion under
Xerxês, was appeased only with the conquest of the island about
twenty years after that event, and with the expulsion and destruction
of its inhabitants some years later. There had been indeed,
according to Herodotus,<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303"
class="fnanchor">[303]</a> a feud of great antiquity between Athens
and Ægina,—of which he gives the account in a singular narrative,
blending together religion, politics, exposition of ancient customs,
etc.; but at the time when the Thebans solicited aid from Ægina, the
latter was at peace with Athens. The Æginetans employed their fleet,
powerful for that day, in ravaging Phalêrum and the maritime demes
of Attica; nor had the Athenians as yet any fleet to resist them.<a
id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>
It is probable that the desired effect was produced, of diverting a
portion of the Athenian force from the war against Bœotia, and thus
partially relieving Thebes. But the war of Athens against both of
them continued for a considerable time, though we have no information
respecting its details.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the attention of Athens was called off from these
combined enemies by a more menacing cloud, which threatened to burst
upon her from the side of Sparta. Kleomenês and his countrymen, full
of resentment at the late inglorious desertion of Eleusis, were yet
more incensed by the discovery, which appears to have been then
recently made, that the injunctions of the Delphian priestess for the
expulsion of Hippias from Athens had been fraudulently procured.<a
id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>
Moreover, Kleomenês, when shut up in the acropolis of Athens with
Isagoras, had found there various prophecies previously treasured
up by the Peisistratids, many of which foreshadowed events highly
disastrous to Sparta. And while the recent brilliant manifestations
of courage, and repeated victories, on the part of Athens, seemed
to indicate that such prophecies might perhaps be realized,—Sparta
had to reproach herself, that, from the foolish and mischievous
conduct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[p. 174]</span> of
Kleomenês, she had undone the effect of her previous aid against
the Peisistratids, and thus lost that return of gratitude which the
Athenians would otherwise have testified. Under such impressions, the
Spartan authorities took the remarkable step of sending for Hippias
from his residence at Sigeium to Peloponnesus, and of summoning
deputies from all their allies to meet him at Sparta.</p>

<p>The convocation thus summoned deserves notice as the commencement
of a new era in Grecian politics. The previous expedition of
Kleomenês against Attica presents to us the first known example
of Spartan headship passing from theory into act: that expedition
miscarried because the allies, though willing to follow, would
not follow blindly, nor be made the instruments of executing
purposes repugnant to their feelings. Sparta had now learned the
necessity, in order to insure their hearty concurrence, of letting
them know what she contemplated, so as to ascertain at least
that she had no decided opposition to apprehend. Here, then, is
the third stage in the spontaneous movement of Greece towards a
systematic conjunction, however imperfect, of its many autonomous
units. First we have Spartan headship suggested in theory, from a
concourse of circumstances which attract to her the admiration of
all Greece,—power, unrivalled training, undisturbed antiquity, etc.:
next, the theory passes into act, yet rude and shapeless: lastly, the
act becomes clothed with formalities, and preceded by discussion and
determination. The first convocation of the allies at Sparta, for the
purpose of having a common object submitted to their consideration,
may well be regarded as an important event in Grecian political
history. The proceedings at the convocation are no less important,
as an indication of the way in which the Greeks of that day felt and
acted, and must be borne in mind as a contrast with times hereafter
to be described.</p>

<p>Hippias having been presented to the assembled allies, the
Spartans expressed their sorrow for having dethroned him,—their
resentment and alarm at the new-born insolence of Athens,<a
id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>
already tasted by her immediate neighbors, and menacing to every
state represented in the convocation,—and their anxiety to<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[p. 175]</span> restore Hippias, not
less as a reparation for past wrong, than as a means, through his
rule, of keeping Athens low and dependent. But the proposition,
though emanating from Sparta, was listened to by the allies with one
common sentiment of repugnance. They had no sympathy for Hippias,—no
dislike, still less any fear, of Athens,—and a profound detestation
of the character of a despot. The spirit which had animated the armed
contingents at Eleusis now reappeared among the deputies at Sparta,
and the Corinthians again took the initiative. Their deputy Sosiklês
protested against the project in the fiercest and most indignant
strain: no language can be stronger than that of the long harangue
which Herodotus puts into his mouth, wherein the bitter recollections
prevalent at Corinth respecting Kypselus and Periander are poured
forth. “Surely, heaven and earth are about to change places,—the
fish are coming to dwell on dry land, and mankind going to inhabit
the sea,—when you, Spartans, propose to subvert the popular
governments, and to set up in the cities that wicked and bloody
thing called a Despot.<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307"
class="fnanchor">[307]</a> First try what it is, for yourselves
at Sparta, and then force it upon others if you can: you have not
tasted its calamities as we have, and you take very good care to
keep it away from yourselves. We adjure you, by the common gods of
Hellas,—plant not despots in her cities: if you persist in a scheme
so wicked, know that the Corinthians will not second you.”</p>

<p>This animated appeal was received with a shout of approbation
and sympathy on the part of the allies. All with one accord united
with Sosiklês in adjuring the Lacedæmonians<a id="FNanchor_308"
href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> “not to revolutionize
any Hellenic city.” No one listened to Hippias when he replied,
warning the Corinthians that the time would come, when they, more
than any one else, would dread and abhor the Athenian democracy, and
wish the Peisistratidæ back again. He knew well, says Herodotus, that
this would be, for he was better acquainted with the prophecies than
any man. But no one then believed him, and he was forced to take
his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[p. 176]</span> departure
back to Sigeium: the Spartans not venturing to espouse his cause
against the determined sentiment of the allies.<a id="FNanchor_309"
href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

<p>That determined sentiment deserves notice, because it marks the
present period of the Hellenic mind: fifty years later it will
be found materially altered. Aversion to single-headed rule, and
bitter recollection of men like Kypselus and Periander, are now
the chords which thrill in an assembly of Grecian deputies: the
idea of a revolution, implying thereby a great and comprehensive
change, of which the party using the word disapproves, consists in
substituting a permanent One in place of those periodical magistrates
and assemblies which were the common attribute of oligarchy and
democracy: the antithesis between these last two is as yet in the
background, nor does there prevail either fear of Athens or hatred of
the Athenian democracy. But when we turn to the period immediately
before the Peloponnesian war, we find the order of precedence
between these two sentiments reversed. The anti-monarchical feeling
has not perished, but has been overlaid by other and more recent
political antipathies,—the antithesis between democracy and oligarchy
having become, not indeed the only sentiment, but the uppermost
sentiment, in the minds of Grecian politicians generally, and the
soul of active party-movement. Moreover, a hatred of the most deadly
character has grown up against Athens and her democracy, especially
in the grandsons of those very Corinthians who now stand forward
as her sympathizing friends. The remarkable change of feeling here
mentioned is nowhere so strikingly exhibited as when we contrast the
address of the Corinthian Sosiklês, just narrated, with the speech
of the Corinthian envoys at Sparta, immediately antecedent to the
Peloponnesian war, as given to us in Thucydidês.<a id="FNanchor_310"
href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> It will hereafter be
fully explained by the intermediate events, by the growth of Athenian
power, and by the still more miraculous development of Athenian
energy.</p>

<p>Such development, the fruit of the fresh-planted democracy as
well as the seed for its sustentation and aggrandizement, continued
progressive during the whole period just adverted to. But the first
unexpected burst of it, under the Kleisthenean constitution, and
after the expulsion of Hippias, is described by<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_177">[p. 177]</span> Herodotus in terms too emphatic to be
omitted. After narrating the successive victories of the Athenians
over both Bœotians and Chalkidians, that historian proceeds: “Thus
did the Athenians grow in strength. And we may find proof, not merely
in this instance but everywhere else, how valuable a thing freedom
is: since even the Athenians, while under a despot, were not superior
in war to any of their surrounding neighbors, but, so soon as they
got rid of their despots, became by far the first of all. These
things show that while kept down by one man, they were slack and
timid, like men working for a master; but when they were liberated,
every single man became eager in exertions for his own benefit.”
The same comparison reappears a short time afterwards, where he
tells us, that “the Athenians when free, felt themselves a match for
Sparta; but while kept down by any man under a despotism, were feeble
and apt for submission.”<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311"
class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p>Stronger expressions cannot be found to depict the rapid
improvement wrought in the Athenian people by their new democracy.
Of course this did not arise merely from suspension of previous
cruelties, or better laws, or better administration. These, indeed,
were essential conditions, but the active transforming cause here
was, the principle and system of which such amendments formed the
detail: the grand and new idea of the sovereign People, composed of
free and equal citizens,—or liberty and equality, to use words which
so profoundly moved the French nation half a century ago. It was this
comprehensive political idea which acted with electric effect upon
the Athenians, creating within them a host of sentiments, motives,
sympathies, and capacities, to which they had before been strangers.
Democracy in Grecian antiquity possessed the privilege,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[p. 178]</span> not only of kindling
an earnest and unanimous attachment to the constitution in the
bosoms of the citizens, but also of creating an energy of public and
private action, such as could never be obtained under an oligarchy,
where the utmost that could be hoped for was a passive acquiescence
and obedience. Mr. Burke has remarked that the mass of the people
are generally very indifferent about theories of government; but
such indifference—although improvements in the practical working
of all governments tend to foster it—is hardly to be expected
among any people who exhibit decided mental activity and spirit
on other matters; and the reverse was unquestionably true, in the
year 500 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, among the communities of
ancient Greece. Theories of government were there anything but a
dead letter: they were connected with emotions of the strongest as
well as of the most opposite character. The theory of a permanent
ruling One, for example, was universally odious: that of a ruling
Few, though acquiesced in, was never positively attractive, unless
either where it was associated with the maintenance of peculiar
education and habits, as at Sparta, or where it presented itself
as the only antithesis to democracy, the latter having by peculiar
circumstances become an object of terror. But the theory of democracy
was preëminently seductive; creating in the mass of the citizens
an intense positive attachment, and disposing them to voluntary
action and suffering on its behalf, such as no coercion on the part
of other governments could extort. Herodotus,<a id="FNanchor_312"
href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> in his comparison
of the three sorts of government, puts in the front rank of the
advantages of democracy, “its most splendid name and promise,”—its
power of enlisting the hearts of the citizens in support of their
constitution, and of providing for all a common bond of union and
fraternity. This is what even democracy did not always do: but it
was what no other government in Greece <i>could</i> do: a reason alone
sufficient to stamp it as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[p.
179]</span> the best government, and presenting the greatest chance
of beneficent results, for a Grecian community. Among the Athenian
citizens, certainly, it produced a strength and unanimity of positive
political sentiment, such as has rarely been seen in the history of
mankind, which excites our surprise and admiration the more when we
compare it with the apathy which had preceded,—and which is even
implied as the natural state of the public mind in Solon’s famous
proclamation against neutrality in a sedition.<a id="FNanchor_313"
href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> Because democracy
happens to be unpalatable to most modern readers, they have been
accustomed to look upon the sentiment here described only in its
least honorable manifestations,—in the caricatures of Aristophanês,
or in the empty common-places of rhetorical declaimers. But it is
not in this way that the force, the earnestness, or the binding
value, of democratical sentiment at Athens is to be measured.
We must listen to it as it comes from the lips of Periklês,<a
id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a>
while he is strenuously enforcing upon the people those active duties
for which it both implanted the stimulus and supplied the courage;
or from the oligarchical Nikias in the harbor of Syracuse, when he
is endeavoring to revive the courage of his despairing troops for
one last death-struggle, and when he appeals to their democratical
patriotism as to the only flame yet alive and burning even in
that moment of agony.<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315"
class="fnanchor">[315]</a> From the time of Kleisthenês downward, the
creation of this new mighty impulse makes an entire revolution in the
Athenian character. And if the change still stood out in so prominent
a manner before the eyes of Herodotus, much more must it have been
felt by the contemporaries among whom it occurred.</p>

<p>The attachment of an Athenian citizen to his democratical
constitution comprised two distinct veins of sentiment: first,
his rights, protection, and advantages derived from it,—next,
his obligations of exertion and sacrifice towards it and with
reference<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[p. 180]</span> to it.
Neither of these two veins of sentiment was ever wholly absent; but
according as the one or the other was present at different times
in varying proportions, the patriotism of the citizen was a very
different feeling. That which Herodotus remarks is, the extraordinary
efforts of heart and hand which the Athenians suddenly displayed,—the
efficacy of the active sentiment throughout the bulk of the citizens;
and we shall observe even more memorable evidences of the same
phenomenon in tracing down the history from Kleisthenês to the end
of the Peloponnesian war: we shall trace a series of events and
motives eminently calculated to stimulate that self-imposed labor
and discipline which the early democracy had first called forth. But
when we advance farther down, from the restoration of the democracy
after the Thirty Tyrants to the time of Demosthenês,—I venture upon
this brief anticipation, in the conviction that one period of Grecian
history can only be thoroughly understood by contrasting it with
another,—we shall find a sensible change in Athenian patriotism. The
active sentiment of obligation is comparatively inoperative,—the
citizen, it is true, has a keen sense of the value of the democracy
as protecting him and insuring to him valuable rights, and he is,
moreover, willing to perform his ordinary sphere of legal duties
towards it; but he looks upon it as a thing established, and capable
of maintaining itself in a due measure of foreign ascendency,
without any such personal efforts as those which his forefathers
cheerfully imposed upon themselves. The orations of Demosthenês
contain melancholy proofs of such altered tone of patriotism,—of that
languor, paralysis, and waiting for others to act, which preceded
the catastrophe of Chæroneia, notwithstanding an unabated attachment
to the democracy as a source of protection and good government.<a
id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>
That same preternatural activity which the allies of Sparta, at the
beginning of the Peloponnesian war, both denounced and admired in the
Athenians, is noted by the orator as now belonging to their enemy
Philip.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[p. 181]</span>Such variations
in the scale of national energy pervade history, modern as well as
ancient, but in regard to Grecian history, especially, they can never
be overlooked. For a certain measure, not only of positive political
attachment, but also of active self-devotion, military readiness,
and personal effort, was the indispensable condition of maintaining
Hellenic autonomy, either in Athens or elsewhere; and became so
more than ever when the Macedonians were once organized under an
enterprising and semi-Hellenized prince. The democracy was the first
creative cause of that astonishing personal and many-sided energy
which marked the Athenian character, for a century downward from
Kleisthenês. That the same ultra-Hellenic activity did not longer
continue, is referable to other causes, which will be hereafter in
part explained. No system of government, even supposing it to be
very much better and more faultless than the Athenian democracy,
can ever pretend to accomplish its legitimate end apart from the
personal character of the people, or to supersede the necessity of
individual virtue and vigor. During the half-century immediately
preceding the battle of Chæroneia, the Athenians had lost that
remarkable energy which distinguished them during the first century
of their democracy, and had fallen much more nearly to a level with
the other Greeks, in common with whom they were obliged to yield to
the pressure of a foreign enemy. I here briefly notice their last
period of languor, in contrast with the first burst of democratical
fervor under Kleisthenês, now opening,—a feeling which will be found,
as we proceed, to continue for a longer period than could have been
reasonably anticipated, but which was too high-strung to become a
perpetual and inherent attribute of any community.</p>

  <h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXII.<br />
    RISE OF THE PERSIAN EMPIRE. — CYRUS.</h2>
</div>

<p class="mt1"><span class="smcap">In the</span> preceding chapter, I
have followed the history of Central Greece very nearly down to the
point at which the history of the Asiatic Greeks becomes blended with
it, and after which the two streams begin to flow to a great degree
in the same channel. I now revert to the affairs of the Asiatic
Greeks, and of the Asiatic kings as connected with them, at the point
in which they were left in my seventeenth chapter.</p>

<p>The concluding facts recounted in that chapter were of sad and
serious moment to the Hellenic world. The Ionic and Æolic Greeks
on the Asiatic coast had been conquered and made tributary by the
Lydian king Crœsus: “down to that time (says Herodotus) all Greeks
had been free.” Their conqueror Crœsus, who ascended the throne in
560 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, appeared to be at the summit of human
prosperity and power in his unassailable capital, and with his
countless treasures at Sardis. His dominions comprised nearly the
whole of Asia Minor, as far as the river Halys to the east; on
the other side of that river began the Median monarchy under his
brother-in-law Astyagês, extending eastward to some boundary which
we cannot define, but comprising in a south-eastern direction Persis
proper, or Farsistan, and separated from the Kissians and Assyrians
on the west by the line of Mount Zagros—the present boundary-line
between Persia and Turkey. Babylonia, with its wondrous city, between
the Euphrates and the Tigris, was occupied by the Assyrians, or
Chaldæans, under their king Labynêtus: a territory populous and
fertile, partly by nature, partly by prodigies of labor, to a degree
which makes us mistrust even an honest eye-witness who describes it
afterwards in its decline,—but which was then in its most flourishing
condition. The Chaldæan dominion under Labynêtus reached to the
borders of Egypt, including, as dependent territories, both Judæa
and Phe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[p. 183]</span>nicia.
In Egypt reigned the native king Amasis, powerful and affluent,
sustained in his throne by a large body of Grecian mercenaries, and
himself favorably disposed to Grecian commerce and settlement. Both
with Labynêtus and with Amasis, Crœsus was on terms of alliance; and
as Astyagês was his brother-in-law, the four kings might well be
deemed out of the reach of calamity. Yet within the space of thirty
years or a little more, the whole of their territories had become
embodied in one vast empire, under the son of an adventurer as yet
not known even by name.</p>

<p>The rise and fall of Oriental dynasties has been in all times
distinguished by the same general features. A brave and adventurous
prince, at the head of a population at once poor, warlike, and
greedy, acquires dominion,—while his successors, abandoning
themselves to sensuality and sloth, probably also to oppressive
and irascible dispositions, become in process of time victims to
those same qualities in a stranger which had enabled their own
father to seize the throne. Cyrus, the great founder of the Persian
empire, first the subject and afterwards the dethroner of the Median
Astyagês, corresponds to this general description, as far at least as
we can pretend to know his history. For in truth, even the conquests
of Cyrus, after he became ruler of Media, are very imperfectly known,
whilst the facts which preceded his rise up to that sovereignty
cannot be said to be known at all: we have to choose between
different accounts at variance with each other, and of which the most
complete and detailed is stamped with all the character of romance.
The Cyropædia of Xenophon is memorable and interesting, considered
with reference to the Greek mind, and as a philosophical novel:<a
id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>
that it should have been quoted so largely as authority on matters
of history, is only one proof among many how easily authors have
been satisfied as to the essentials of historical evidence. The
narrative given by Herodotus of the relations between Cyrus and
Astyagês, agreeing with Xenophon in little more than the fact that it
makes Cyrus son of Kambysês and Mandanê, and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_184">[p. 184]</span> grandson of Astyagês, goes even beyond
the story of Romulus and Remus in respect to tragical incident and
contrast. Astyagês, alarmed by a dream, condemns the new-born infant
of his daughter Mandanê to be exposed: Harpagus, to whom the order is
given, delivers the child to one of the royal herdsmen, who exposes
it in the mountains, where it is miraculously suckled by a bitch.<a
id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>
Thus preserved, and afterwards brought up as the herdsman’s child,
Cyrus manifests great superiority both physical and mental, is
chosen king in play by the boys of the village, and in this capacity
severely chastises the son of one of the courtiers; for which offence
he is carried before Astyagês, who recognizes him for his grandson,
but is assured by the Magi that his dream is out, and that he has no
farther danger to apprehend from the boy,—and therefore permits him
to live. With Harpagus, however, Astyagês is extremely incensed, for
not having executed his orders: he causes the son of Harpagus to be
slain, and served up to be eaten by his unconscious father at a regal
banquet. The father, apprized afterwards of the fact, dissembles his
feelings, but conceives a deadly vengeance against Astyagês for this
Thyestean meal. He persuades Cyrus, who has been sent back to his
father and mother in Persia, to head a revolt<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_185">[p. 185]</span> of the Persians against the Medes;
whilst Astyagês—to fill up the Grecian conception of madness as a
precursor to ruin—sends an army against the revolters, commanded by
Harpagus himself. Of course the army is defeated,—Astyagês, after a
vain resistance, is dethroned,—Cyrus becomes king in his place,—and
Harpagus repays the outrage which he has undergone by the bitterest
insults.</p>

<p>Such are the heads of a beautiful narrative which is given at
some length in Herodotus. It will probably appear to the reader
sufficiently romantic, though the historian intimates that he
had heard three other narratives different from it, and that all
were more full of marvels, as well as in wider circulation, than
his own, which he had borrowed from some unusually sober-minded
Persian informants.<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319"
class="fnanchor">[319]</a> In what points the other three stories
departed from it, we do not hear.</p>

<p>To the historian of Halikarnassus, we have to oppose the
physician of the neighboring town Knidus,—Ktêsias, who contradicted
Herodotus, not without strong terms of censure, on many points,
and especially upon that which is the very foundation of the early
narrative respecting Cyrus; for he affirmed that Cyrus was noway
related to Astyagês.<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320"
class="fnanchor">[320]</a> However indignant we may be with Ktêsias,
for the disparaging epithets which he presumed to apply to an
historian whose work is to us inestimable,—we must nevertheless
admit that as surgeon, in actual attendance on king Artaxerxês
Mnêmon, and healer of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[p.
186]</span> wound inflicted on that prince at Kunaxa by his brother
Cyrus the younger,<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321"
class="fnanchor">[321]</a> he had better opportunities even than
Herodotus of conversing with sober-minded Persians; and that the
discrepancies between the two statements are to be taken as a proof
of the prevalence of discordant, yet equally accredited, stories.
Herodotus himself was in fact compelled to choose one out of four. So
rare and late a plant is historical authenticity.</p>

<p>That Cyrus was the first Persian conqueror, and that the space
which he overran covered no less than fifty degrees of longitude,
from the coast of Asia Minor to the Oxus and the Indus, are facts
quite indisputable; but of the steps by which this was achieved, we
know very little. The native Persians, whom he conducted to an empire
so immense, were an aggregate of seven agricultural and four nomadic
tribes,—all of them rude, hardy, and brave,<a id="FNanchor_322"
href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a>—dwelling in a
mountainous region, clothed in skins, ignorant of wine or fruit, or
any of the commonest luxuries of life, and despising the very idea
of purchase or sale. Their tribes were very unequal in point of
dignity, probably also in respect to numbers and powers, among one
another: first in estimation among them stood the Pasargadæ; and the
first phratry, or clan, among the Pasargadæ were the Achæmenidæ,
to whom Cyrus himself belonged. Whether his relationship to the
Median king whom he dethroned was a matter of fact, or a politic
fiction, we cannot well determine. But Xenophon, in noticing the
spacious deserted cities, Larissa and Mespila,<a id="FNanchor_323"
href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> which he saw in his
march with the Ten Thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[p.
187]</span> Greeks on the eastern side of the Tigris, gives us to
understand that the conquest of Media by the Persians was reported
to him as having been an obstinate and protracted struggle. However
this may be, the preponderance of the Persians was at last complete:
though the Medes always continued to be the second nation in the
empire, after the Persians, properly so called; and by early Greek
writers the great enemy in the East is often called “the Mede,<a
id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>”
as well as “the Persian.” Ekbatana always continued to be one of
the capital cities, and the usual summer residence, of the kings of
Persia; Susa on the Choaspês, on the Kissian plain farther southward,
and east of the Tigris, being their winter abode.</p>

<p>The vast space of country comprised between the Indus on the
east, the Oxus and Caspian sea to the north, the Persian gulf and
Indian ocean to the south, and the line of Mount Zagros to the west,
appears to have been occupied in these times by a great variety of
different tribes and people, but all or most of them belonging to the
religion of Zoroaster, and speaking dialects of the Zend language.<a
id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>
It was known amongst its inhabitants by the common name of Iran, or
Aria: it is, in its central parts at least, a high, cold plateau,
totally destitute of wood and scantily supplied with water; much of
it, indeed, is a salt and sandy desert, unsusceptible of culture.
Parts of it are eminently fertile, where water can be procured
and irrigation applied; and scattered masses of tolerably dense
population thus grew up. But continuity of cultivation is not
practicable, and in ancient times, as at present, a large proportion
of the population of Iran seems to have consisted of wandering or
nomadic tribes, with their tents and cattle. The rich pastures,
and the freshness of the summer climate, in the region of mountain
and valley near Ekbatana, are extolled by modern travellers, just
as they attracted the Great King in ancient times, during the hot
months. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[p. 188]</span>
more southerly province called Persis proper (Farsistan) consists
also in part of mountain land interspersed with valley and plain,
abundantly watered, and ample in pasture, sloping gradually down
to low grounds on the sea-coast which are hot and dry. The care
bestowed, both by Medes and Persians, on the breeding of their
horses, was remarkable.<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326"
class="fnanchor">[326]</a> There were doubtless material differences
between different parts of the population of this vast plateau
of Iran. Yet it seems that, along with their common language and
religion, they had also something of a common character, which
contrasted with the Indian population east of the Indus, the
Assyrians west of Mount Zagros, and the Massagetæ and other Nomads
of the Caspian and the sea of Aral,—less brutish, restless, and
bloodthirsty, than the latter,—more fierce, contemptuous, and
extortionate, and less capable of sustained industry, than the two
former. There can be little doubt, at the time of which we are now
speaking, when the wealth and cultivation of Assyria were at their
maximum, that Iran also was far better peopled than ever it has been
since European observers have been able to survey it; especially the
north-eastern portion, Baktria and Sogdiana: so that the invasions of
the nomads from Turkestan and Tartary, which have been so destructive
at various intervals since the Mohammedan conquest, were before that
period successfully kept back.</p>

<p>The general analogy among the population of Iran probably enabled
the Persian conqueror with comparative ease to extend his empire
to the east, after the conquest of Ekbatana, and to become the
full heir of the Median kings. And if we may believe Ktêsias, even
the distant province of Baktria had been before subject to those
kings: it at first resisted Cyrus, but finding that he had become
son-in-law of Astyagês as well as master of his person, it speedily
acknowledged his authority.<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327"
class="fnanchor">[327]</a></p>

<p>According to the representation of Herodotus, the war between
Cyrus and Crœsus of Lydia began shortly after the capture of
Astyagês, and before the conquest of Baktria.<a id="FNanchor_328"
href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> Crœsus was<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[p. 189]</span> the assailant, wishing
to avenge his brother-in-law, to arrest the growth of the Persian
conqueror, and to increase his own dominions: his more prudent
councillors in vain represented to him that he had little to gain,
and much to lose, by war with a nation alike hardy and poor. He is
represented, as just at that time recovering from the affliction
arising out of the death of his son. To ask advice of the oracle,
before he took any final decision, was a step which no pious king
would omit; but in the present perilous question, Crœsus did more,—he
took a precaution so extreme, that, if his piety had not been placed
beyond all doubt by his extraordinary munificence to the temples, he
might have drawn upon himself the suspicion of a guilty skepticism.<a
id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>
Before he would send to ask advice respecting the project itself,
he resolved to test the credit of some of the chief surrounding
oracles,—Delphi, Dôdôna, Branchidæ near Milêtus, Amphiaraus at
Thebes, Trophônius at Lebadeia, and Ammôn in Libya. His envoys
started from Sardis on the same day, and were all directed on the
hundredth day afterwards to ask at the respective oracles how Crœsus
was at that precise moment employed. This was a severe trial: of the
manner in which it was met by four out of the six oracles consulted,
we have no information, and it rather appears that their answers were
unsatisfactory. But Amphiaraus maintained his credit undiminished,
and Apollo at Delphi, more omniscient than Apollo at Branchidæ,
solved the question with such unerring precision, as to afford a
strong additional argument against persons who might be disposed
to scoff at divination. No sooner had the envoys put the question
to the Delphian priestess, on the day named, “What is Crœsus now
doing?” than she exclaimed, in the accustomed hexameter verse,<a
id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>
“I know the number of grains of sand, and the measures of the
sea; I understand the dumb, and I hear the man who speaks not.
The smell reaches me of a hard-skinned tortoise boiled in a
copper with lamb’s flesh,—copper above and copper below.” Crœsus
was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[p. 190]</span> awestruck
on receiving this reply. It described with the utmost detail that
which he had been really doing, insomuch that he accounted the
Delphian oracle and that of Amphiaraus the only trustworthy oracles
on earth,—following up these feelings with a holocaust of the most
munificent character, in order to win the favor of the Delphian god.
Three thousand cattle were offered up, and upon a vast sacrificial
pile were placed the most splendid purple robes and tunics, together
with couches and censers of gold and silver: besides which he sent
to Delphi itself the richest presents in gold and silver,—ingots,
statues, bowls, jugs, etc., the size and weight of which we read with
astonishment; the more so as Herodotus himself saw them a century
afterwards at Delphi.<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331"
class="fnanchor">[331]</a> Nor was Crœsus altogether unmindful of
Amphiaraus, whose answer had been creditable, though less triumphant
than that of the Pythian priestess. He sent to Amphiaraus a spear
and shield of pure gold, which were afterwards seen at Thebes by
Herodotus: this large donative may help the reader to conceive the
immensity of those which he sent to Delphi.</p>

<p>The envoys who conveyed these gifts were instructed to ask, at
the same time, whether Crœsus should undertake an expedition against
the Persians,—and, if so, whether he should prevail on any allies
to assist him. In regard to the second question, the answer both of
Apollo and Amphiaraus was decisive, recommending him to invite the
alliance of the most powerful Greeks. In regard to the first and most
momentous question, their answer was as remarkable for circumspection
as it had been before for detective sagacity: they told Crœsus that,
if he invaded the Persians, he would subvert a mighty monarchy. The
blindness of Crœsus interpreted this declaration into an unqualified
promise of success. He sent farther presents to the oracle, and again
inquired whether his kingdom would be durable. “When a mule shall
become king of the Medes (replied the priestess), then must thou
run away,—be not ashamed.”<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332"
class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>More assured than ever by such an answer, Crœsus sent to Sparta,
under the kings Anaxandridês and Aristo, to tender presents and
solicit their alliance.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333"
class="fnanchor">[333]</a> His propositions were fa<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[p. 191]</span>vorably entertained,—the
more so, as he had before gratuitously furnished some gold to the
Lacedæmonians, for a statue to Apollo. The alliance now formed was
altogether general,—no express effort being as yet demanded from
them, though it soon came to be. But the incident is to be noted,
as marking the first plunge of the leading Grecian state into
Asiatic politics; and that too without any of the generous Hellenic
sympathy which afterwards induced Athens to send her citizens
across the Ægean. Crœsus was the master and tribute-exactor of the
Asiatic Greeks, and their contingents seem to have formed part of
his army for the expedition now contemplated; which army consisted
principally, not of native Lydians, but of foreigners.</p>

<p>The river Halys formed the boundary at this time between the
Median and Lydian empires: and Crœsus, marching across that river
into the territory of the Syrians or Assyrians of Kappadokia,
took the city of Pteria and many of its surrounding dependencies,
inflicting damage and destruction upon these distant subjects of
Ekbatana. Cyrus lost no time in bringing an army to their defence
considerably larger than that of Crœsus, and at the same time
tried, though unsuccessfully, to prevail on the Ionians to revolt
from him. A bloody battle took place between the two armies, but
with indecisive result: and Crœsus, seeing that he could not hope
to accomplish more with his forces as they stood, thought it wise
to return to his capital, in order to collect a larger army for
the next campaign. Immediately on reaching Sardis, he despatched
envoys to Labynêtus king of Babylon; to Amasis king of Egypt; to the
Lacedæmonians, and to other allies; calling upon all of them to send
auxiliaries to Sardis during the course of the fifth coming month. In
the mean time, he dismissed all the foreign troops who had followed
him into Kappadokia.<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334"
class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p>

<p>Had these allies appeared, the war might perhaps have been
prosecuted with success; and on the part of the Lacedæmonians at
least, there was no tardiness; for their ships were ready and their
troops almost on board, when the unexpected news reached them that
Crœsus was already ruined.<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335"
class="fnanchor">[335]</a> Cyrus had foreseen and forestalled the
defensive plan of his enemy. He pushed on with<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_192">[p. 192]</span> his army to Sardis without delay,
compelling the Lydian prince to give battle with his own unassisted
subjects. The open and spacious plain before that town was highly
favorable to the Lydian cavalry, which at that time, Herodotus
tells us, was superior to the Persian. But Cyrus devised a
stratagem whereby this cavalry was rendered unavailable,—placing
in front of his line the baggage camels, which the Lydian horses
could not endure either to smell or to behold.<a id="FNanchor_336"
href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> The horsemen of
Crœsus were thus obliged to dismount; nevertheless, they fought
bravely on foot, and were not driven into the town till after a
sanguinary combat.</p>

<p>Though confined within the walls of his capital, Crœsus had
still good reason for hoping to hold out until the arrival of his
allies, to whom he sent pressing envoys of acceleration: for Sardis
was considered impregnable,—one assault had already been repulsed,
and the Persians would have been reduced to the slow process of
blockade. But on the fourteenth day of the siege, accident did for
the besiegers that which they could not have accomplished either
by skill or force. Sardis was situated on an outlying peak of the
northern side of Tmôlus; it was well-fortified everywhere except
towards the mountain; and on that side, the rock, was so precipitous
and inaccessible, that fortifications were thought unnecessary, nor
did the inhabitants believe assault to be possible. But Hyrœades,
a Persian soldier, having accidentally seen one of the garrison
descending this precipitous rock to pick up his helmet, which had
rolled down, watched his opportunity, tried to climb up, and found it
not impracticable. Others followed his example, the strong-hold was
thus seized first, and the whole city was speedily taken by storm.<a
id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<p>Cyrus had given especial orders to spare the life of Crœsus,
who was accordingly made prisoner. But preparations were made for
a solemn and terrible spectacle. The captive king was destined to
be burnt in chains, together with fourteen Lydian youths, on a
vast pile of wood: and we are even told that the pile was already
kindled and the victim beyond the reach of human aid, when Apollo
sent a miraculous rain to preserve him.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_193">[p. 193]</span> As to the general fact of supernatural
interposition, in one way or another, Herodotus and Ktêsias
both agree, though they describe differently the particular
miracles wrought.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338"
class="fnanchor">[338]</a> It is certain that Crœsus, after
some time, was released and well treated by his conqueror, and
lived to become the confidential adviser of the latter as well
as of his son Kambysês:<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339"
class="fnanchor">[339]</a> Ktêsias also acquaints us that a
considerable town and territory near Ekbatana, called Barênê, was
assigned to him, according to a practice which we shall find not
unfrequent with the Persian kings.</p>

<p>The prudent counsel and remarks as to the relations between
Persians and Lydians, whereby Crœsus is said by Herodotus to have
first earned this favorable treatment, are hardly worth repeating;
but the indignant remonstrance sent by Crœsus to the Delphian god
is too characteristic to be passed over. He obtained permission
from Cyrus to lay upon the holy pavement of the Delphian temple the
chains with which he had at first been bound. The Lydian envoys were
instructed, after exhibiting to the god these<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_194">[p. 194]</span> humiliating memorials, to ask whether
it was his custom to deceive his benefactors, and whether he was not
ashamed to have encouraged the king of Lydia in an enterprise so
disastrous? The god, condescending to justify himself by the lips
of the priestess, replied: “Not even a god can escape his destiny.
Crœsus has suffered for the sin of his fifth ancestor (Gygês), who,
conspiring with a woman, slew his master and wrongfully seized the
sceptre. Apollo employed all his influence with the Mœræ (Fates) to
obtain that this sin might be expiated by the children of Crœsus,
and not by Crœsus himself; but the Mœræ would grant nothing more
than a postponement of the judgment for three years. Let Crœsus know
that Apollo has thus procured for him a reign three years longer
than his original destiny,<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340"
class="fnanchor">[340]</a> after having tried in vain to rescue him
altogether. Moreover, he sent that rain which at the critical moment
extinguished the burning pile. Nor has Crœsus any right to complain
of the prophecy by which he was encouraged to enter on the war; for
when the god told him, that he would subvert <i>a great empire</i>, it was
his duty to have again inquired which empire the god meant; and if he
neither understood the meaning, nor chose to ask for information, he
has himself to blame for the result. Besides, Crœsus neglected the
warning given to him, about the acquisition of the Median kingdom
by a mule: Cyrus was that mule,—son of a Median mother of royal
breed, by a Persian father, at once of different race and of lower
position.”</p>

<p>This triumphant justification extorted even from Crœsus himself a
full confession, that the sin lay with him, and not with the god.<a
id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a>
It certainly illustrates, in a remarkable manner, the theological
ideas of the time; and it shows us how much, in the mind<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[p. 195]</span> of Herodotus, the
facts of the centuries preceding his own, unrecorded as they were
by any contemporary authority, tended to cast themselves into a
sort of religious drama; the threads of the historical web being
in part put together, in part originally spun, for the purpose of
setting forth the religious sentiment and doctrine woven in as a
pattern. The Pythian priestess predicts to Gygês that the crime
which he had committed in assassinating his master would be expiated
by his fifth descendant, though, as Herodotus tells us, no one
took any notice of this prophecy until it was at last fulfilled:<a
id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>
we see thus that the history of the first Mermnad king is made up
after the catastrophe of the last. There was something in the main
facts of the history of Crœsus profoundly striking to the Greek mind:
a king at the summit of wealth and power,—pious in the extreme,
and munificent towards the gods,—the first destroyer of Hellenic
liberty in Asia,—then precipitated, at once and on a sudden, into
the abyss of ruin. The sin of the first parent helped much towards
the solution of this perplexing problem, as well as to exalt the
credit of the oracle, when made to assume the shape of an unnoticed
prophecy. In the affecting story (discussed in a former chapter<a
id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>) of
Solon and Crœsus, the Lydian king is punished with an acute domestic
affliction, because he thought himself the happiest of mankind,—the
gods not suffering anyone to be arrogant except themselves;<a
id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a>
and the warning of Solon is made to recur to Crœsus after he has
become the prisoner of Cyrus, in the narrative of Herodotus. To
the same vein of thought belongs the story, just recounted, of the
relations of Crœsus with the Delphian oracle. An account is provided,
satisfactory to the religious feelings of the Greeks, how and why he
was ruined,—but nothing less than the overruling and omnipotent Mœræ
could be invoked to explain so stupendous a result.</p>

<p>It is rarely that these supreme goddesses, or
hyper-goddesses—since the gods themselves must submit to them—are
brought into such distinct light and action. Usually, they are
kept in the dark, or are left to be understood as the unseen
stumbling-block<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[p. 196]</span>
in cases of extreme incomprehensibility; and it is difficult
clearly to determine (as in the case of some complicated political
constitutions) where the Greeks conceived sovereign power to
reside, in respect to the government of the world. But here the
sovereignty of the Mœræ, and the subordinate agency of the gods, are
unequivocally set forth.<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345"
class="fnanchor">[345]</a> Yet the gods are still extremely pow<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[p. 197]</span>erful, because the
Mœræ comply with their requests up to a certain point, not thinking
it proper to be wholly inexorable; but their compliance is carried
no farther than they themselves choose. Nor would they, even in
deference to Apollo,<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346"
class="fnanchor">[346]</a> alter the original sentence of punishment
for the sin of Gygês in the person of his fifth descendant,—a
sentence, moreover, which Apollo himself had formally prophesied
shortly after the sin was committed; so that, if the Mœræ had
listened to his intercession on behalf of Crœsus, his own prophetic
credit would have been endangered. Their unalterable resolution
has predetermined the ruin of Crœsus, and the grandeur of the
event is manifested by the circumstance, that even Apollo himself
cannot prevail upon them to alter it, or to grant more than a
three years’ respite. The religious element must here be viewed as
giving the form—the historical element as giving the matter only,
and not the whole matter—of the story; and these two elements will
be found conjoined more or less throughout most of the history of
Herodotus, though, as we descend to later times, we shall find
the historical element in constantly increasing proportion. His
conception of history is extremely different from that of Thucydidês,
who lays down to himself the true scheme and purpose of the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[p. 198]</span> historian, common to
him with the philosopher,—to recount and interpret the past, as a
rational aid towards the prevision of the future.<a id="FNanchor_347"
href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<p>The destruction of the Lydian monarchy, and the establishment
of the Persians at Sardis—an event pregnant with consequences
to Hellas generally—took place in 546 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small><a
id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>
Sorely did the Ionic Greeks now repent that they had rejected the
propositions made to them by Cyrus for revolting from Crœsus,—though
at the time when these propositions were made, it would have been
highly imprudent to listen to them, since the Lydian power might
reasonably be looked upon as the stronger. As soon as Sardis had
fallen, they sent envoys to the conqueror, entreating that they
might be enrolled as his tributaries, on the footing which they had
occupied under Crœsus. The reply was a stern and angry refusal,
with the exception of the Milesians, to whom the terms which they
asked were granted:<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349"
class="fnanchor">[349]</a> why this favorable exception was extended
to them, we do not know. The other continental Ionians and Æolians
(exclusive of Milêtus, and exclusive also of the insular cities which
the Persians had no means of attacking), seized with alarm, began to
put themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[p. 199]</span>
in a condition of defence: it seems that the Lydian king had caused
their fortifications to be wholly or partially dismantled, for we are
told that they now began to erect walls; and the Phôkæans especially
devoted to that purpose a present which they had received from the
Iberian Arganthônius, king of Tartêssus. Besides thus strengthening
their own cities, they thought it advisable to send a joint embassy
entreating aid from Sparta; they doubtless were not unapprized that
the Spartans had actually equipped an army for the support of Crœsus.
Their deputies went to Sparta, where the Phôkæan Pythermus, appointed
by the rest to be spokesman, clothing himself in a purple robe,<a
id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>
in order to attract the largest audience possible, set forth
their pressing need of succor against the impending danger. The
Lacedæmonians refused the prayer; nevertheless, they despatched to
Phôkæa some commissioners to investigate the state of affairs,—who
perhaps, persuaded by the Phôkæans, sent Lakrinês, one of their
number, to the conqueror at Sardis, to warn him that he should not
lay hands on any city of Hellas,—for the Lacedæmonians would not
permit it. “Who are these Lacedæmonians? (inquired Cyrus from some
Greeks who stood near him)—how many are there of them, that they
venture to send me such a notice?” Having received the answer,
wherein it was stated that the Lacedæmonians had a city and a regular
market at Sparta, he exclaimed: “I have never yet been afraid of men
like these, who have a set place in the middle of their city, where
they meet to cheat one another and forswear themselves. If I live,
they shall have troubles of their own to talk about, apart from the
Ionians.” To buy or sell, appeared to the Persians a contemptible
practice; for they carried out consistently, one step farther, the
principle upon which even many able Greeks condemned the lending
of money on interest; and the speech of Cyrus was intended as a
covert reproach of Grecian habits generally.<a id="FNanchor_351"
href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>

<p>This blank menace of Lakrinês, an insulting provocation to<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[p. 200]</span> the enemy rather
than a real support to the distressed, was the only benefit which
the Ionic Greeks derived from Sparta. They were left to defend
themselves as best they could against the conqueror; who presently,
however, quitted Sardis to prosecute in person his conquests in
the East, leaving the Persian Tabalus with a garrison in the
citadel, but consigning both the large treasure captured, and the
authority over the Lydian population, to the Lydian Paktyas. As he
carried away Crœsus along with him, he probably considered himself
sure of the fidelity of those Lydians whom the deposed monarch
recommended. But he had not yet arrived at his own capital, when
he received the intelligence that Paktyas had revolted, arming the
Lydian population, and employing the treasure in his charge to
hire fresh troops. On hearing this news, Cyrus addressed himself
to Crœsus, according to Herodotus, in terms of much wrath against
the Lydians, and even intimated that he should be compelled to
sell them all as slaves. Upon which Crœsus, full of alarm for his
people, contended strenuously that Paktyas alone was in fault,
and deserving of punishment; but he at the same time advised
Cyrus to disarm the Lydian population, and to enforce upon them
effeminate attire, together with habits of playing on the harp and
shopkeeping. “By this process (he said) you will soon see them become
women instead of men.”<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352"
class="fnanchor">[352]</a> This suggestion is said to have been
accepted by Cyrus, and executed by his general Mazarês. The
conversation here reported, and the deliberate plan for enervating
the Lydian character supposed to be pursued by Cyrus, is evidently an
hypothesis imagined by some of the contemporaries or predecessors of
Herodotus,—to explain the contrast between the Lydians whom they saw
before them, after two or three generations of slavery, and the old
irresistible horsemen of whom they heard in fame, at the time when
Crœsus was lord from the Halys to the Ægean sea.</p>

<p>To return to Paktyas,—he had commenced his revolt, come down
to the sea-coast, and employed the treasures of Sardis in levying
a Grecian mercenary force, with which he invested the place and
blocked up the governor Tabalus. But he manifested no courage worthy
of so dangerous an enterprise; for no sooner<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_201">[p. 201]</span> had he heard that the Median general
Mazarês was approaching at the head of an army dispatched by Cyrus
against him, than he disbanded his force and fled to Kymê for
protection as a suppliant. Presently, arrived a menacing summons
from Mazarês, demanding that he should be given up forthwith, which
plunged the Kymæans into profound dismay; for the idea of giving
up a suppliant to destruction was shocking to Grecian sentiment.
They sent to solicit advice from the holy temple of Apollo, at
Branchidæ near Milêtus; and the reply directed, that Paktyas should
be surrendered. Nevertheless, so ignominious did such a surrender
appear, that Aristodikus and some other Kymæan citizens denounced the
messengers as liars, and required that a more trustworthy deputation
should be sent to consult the god. Aristodikus himself, forming
one of the second body, stated the perplexity to the oracle, and
received a repetition of the same answer; whereupon he proceeded to
rob the birds’-nests which existed in abundance in and about the
temple. A voice from the inner oracular chamber speedily arrested
him, exclaiming: “Most impious of men, how darest thou to do such
things? Wilt thou snatch my suppliants from the temple itself?”
Unabashed by the rebuke, Aristodikus replied: “Master, thus dost
<i>thou</i> help suppliants thyself: and dost thou command the Kymæans
to give up a suppliant?” “Yes, I do command it<a id="FNanchor_353"
href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> (rejoined the god
forthwith), in order that the crime may bring destruction upon you
the sooner, and that you may not in future come to consult the oracle
upon the surrender of suppliants.”</p>

<p>The ingenuity of Aristodikus completely nullified the oracular
response, and left the Kymæans in their original perplexity. Not
choosing to surrender Paktyas, nor daring to protect him against a
besieging army, they sent him away to Mitylênê, whither the envoys of
Mazarês followed and demanded him; offering a reward so considerable,
that the Kymæans became fearful of trusting them, and again conveyed
away the suppliant to Chios, where he took refuge in the temple of
Athênê Poliuchus. But here again the pursuers followed, and the
Chians were persuaded to drag him from the temple and surrender him,
on consideration of receiving the territory of Atarneus (a dis<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[p. 202]</span>trict on the continent
over against the island of Lesbos) as purchase-money. Paktyas was
thus seized and sent prisoner to Cyrus, who had given the most
express orders for this capture: hence the unusual intensity of the
pursuit. But it appears that the territory of Atarneus was considered
as having been ignominiously acquired by the Chians; none even of
their own citizens would employ any article of its produce for holy
or sacrificial purposes.<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354"
class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<p>Mazarês next proceeded to the attack and conquest of the Greeks on
the coast; an enterprise which, since he soon died of illness, was
completed by his successor Harpagus. The towns assailed successively
made a gallant but ineffectual resistance: the Persian general by
his numbers drove the defenders within their walls, against which
he piled up mounds of earth, so as either to carry the place by
storm or to compel surrender. All of them were reduced, one after
the other: with all, the terms of subjection were doubtless harder
than those which had been imposed upon them by Crœsus, because
Cyrus had already refused to grant these terms to them, with the
single exception of Milêtus, and because they had since given
additional offence by aiding the revolt of Paktyas. The inhabitants
of Priênê were sold into slavery: they were the first assailed by
Mazarês, and had perhaps been especially forward in the attack made
by Paktyas on Sardis.<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355"
class="fnanchor">[355]</a></p>

<p>Among these unfortunate towns, thus changing their master
and passing out into a harsher subjection, two deserve especial
notice,—Teôs and Phôkæa. The citizens of the former, so soon<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[p. 203]</span> as the mound around
their walls had rendered farther resistance impossible, embarked
and emigrated, some to Thrace, where they founded Abdêra,—others
to the Cimmerian Bosphorus, where they planted Phanagoria; a
portion of them, however, must have remained to take the chances
of subjection, since the town appears in after-times still peopled
and still Hellenic.<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356"
class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

<p>The fate of Phôkæa, similar in the main, is given to us with
more striking circumstances of detail, and becomes the more
interesting, since the enterprising mariners who inhabited it had
been the torch-bearers of Grecian geographical discovery in the
west. I have already described their adventurous exploring voyages
of former days into the interior of the Adriatic, and along the
whole northern and western coasts of the Mediterranean as far as
Tartêssus (the region around and adjoining to Cadiz),—together with
the favorable reception given to them by old Arganthônius, king of
the country, who invited them to emigrate in a body to his kingdom,
offering them the choice of any site which they might desire. His
invitation was declined, though probably the Phôkæans may have
subsequently regretted the refusal; and he then manifested his
good-will towards them by a large present to defray the expense of
constructing fortifications round their town.<a id="FNanchor_357"
href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> The walls, erected
in part, by this aid, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[p.
204]</span> both extensive and well built; yet they could not hinder
Harpagus from raising his mounds of earth up against them, while
he was politic enough at the same time to tempt them with offers
of a moderate capitulation; requiring only that they should breach
their walls in one place by pulling down one of the towers, and
consecrate one building in the interior of the town as a token of
subjection. To accept these terms, was to submit themselves to the
discretion of the besieger, for there could be no security that they
would be observed; and the Phôkæans, while they asked for one day
to deliberate upon their reply, entreated that, during that day,
Harpagus should withdraw his troops altogether from the walls. With
this demand the latter complied, intimating, at the same time, that
he saw clearly through the meaning of it. The Phôkæans had determined
that the inevitable servitude impending over their town should not be
shared by its inhabitants, and they employed their day of grace in
preparation for collective exile, putting on ship-board their wives
and children as well as their furniture and the movable decorations
of their temples. They then set sail for Chios, leaving to the
conqueror a deserted town for the occupation of a Persian garrison.<a
id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[p. 205]</span>It appears
that the fugitives were not very kindly received at Chios; at least,
when they made a proposition for purchasing from the Chians the
neighboring islands of Œnussæ as a permanent abode, the latter were
induced to refuse by apprehensions of commercial rivalry. It was
necessary to look farther for a settlement: and Arganthônius their
protector, being now dead, Tartêssus was no longer inviting. Twenty
years before, however, the colony of Alalia in the island of Corsica
had been founded from Phôkæa by the direction of the oracle, and
thither the general body of Phôkæans now resolved to repair. Having
prepared their ships for this distant voyage, they first sailed back
to Phôkæa, surprised the Persian garrison whom Harpagus had left
in the town, and slew them: they then sunk in the harbor a great
lump of iron, and bound themselves by a solemn and unanimous oath
never again to see Phôkæa until that iron should come up to the
surface. Nevertheless, in spite of the oath, the voyage of exile
had been scarcely begun when more than half of them repented of
having so bound themselves,—and became homesick.<a id="FNanchor_359"
href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> They broke their vow
and returned to Phôkæa. But as Herodotus does not mention any divine
judgment as having been consequent on the perjury, we may, perhaps,
suspect that some gray-headed citizen, to whom transportation to
Corsica might be little less than a sentence of death, both persuaded
himself, and certified to his companions, that he had seen the
sunken lump of iron raised up and floating for a while buoyant upon
the waves. Harpagus must have been induced to pardon the previous
slaughter of his Persian garrison, or at least to believe that it
had been done by those Phôkæans who still persisted in exile. He
wanted tribute-paying subjects, not an empty military post, and the
repentant home-seekers were allowed to number themselves among the
slaves of the Great King.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the smaller but more resolute half of the Phôkæans
executed their voyage to Alalia in Corsica, with their<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[p. 206]</span> wives and children, in
sixty pentekontêrs, or armed ships, and established themselves along
with the previous settlers. They remained there for five years,<a
id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a>
during which time their indiscriminate piracies had become so
intolerable (even at that time, piracy committed against a foreign
vessel seems to have been both frequent and practised without much
disrepute), that both the Tyrrhenian seaports along the Mediterranean
coast of Italy, and the Carthaginians, united to put them down. There
subsisted particular treaties between these two, for the regulation
of the commercial intercourse between Africa and Italy, of which
the ancient treaty preserved by Polybius between Rome and Carthage
(made in 509 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>) may be considered as a specimen.<a
id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a>
Sixty Carthaginian and as many Tuscan ships attacked the sixty
Phôkæan ships near Alalia, and destroyed forty of them, yet not
without such severe loss to themselves that the victory was said
to be on the side of the latter; who, however, in spite of this
Kadmeian victory (so a battle was denominated in which the victors
lost more than the vanquished), were compelled to carry back their
remaining twenty vessels to Alalia, and to retire with their wives
and families, in so far as room could be found for them, to Rhegium.
At last, these unhappy exiles found a permanent home by establishing
the new settlement of Elea, or Velia, in the gulf of Policastro, on
the Italian coast (then called Œnôtrian) southward from Poseidônia,
or Pæstum. It is probable that they were here joined by other exiles
from Ionia, in particular by the Kolophonian philosopher and poet
Xenophanês, from whom what was afterwards called the Eleatic school
of philosophy, distinguished both for bold consistency and dialectic
acuteness, took its rise. The Phôkæan captives, taken prisoners in
the naval combat by Tyrrhenians and Carthaginians, were stoned to
death; but a divine judgment overtook the Tyrrhenian town of Agylla,
in consequence of this cruelty; and even in the time of Herodotus,
a century afterwards, the Agyllæans were still expiating the sin
by a periodical solemnity and agon, pursuant to the penalty which
the Delphian oracle had imposed upon them.<a id="FNanchor_362"
href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>

<p>Such was the fate of the Phôkæan exiles, while their
brethren<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[p. 207]</span> at home
remained as subjects of Harpagus, in common with all the other Ionic
and Æolic Greeks except Milêtus. For even the insular inhabitants of
Lesbos and Chios, though not assailable by sea, since the Persians
had no fleet, thought it better to renounce their independence and
enrol themselves as Persian subjects,—both of them possessing strips
of the mainland which they were unable to protect otherwise. Samos,
on the other hand, maintained its independence, and even reached,
shortly after this period, under the despotism of Polykratês, a
higher degree of power than ever. Perhaps the humiliation of the
other maritime Greeks around may have rather favored the ambition
of this unscrupulous prince, to whom I shall revert presently. But
we may readily conceive that the public solemnities in which the
Ionic Greeks intermingled, in place of those gay and richly-decked
crowds which the Homeric hymn describes in the preceding century as
assembled at Delos, presented scenes of marked despondency: one of
their wisest men, indeed, Bias of Priênê, went so far as to propose,
at the Pan-Ionic festival, a collective emigration of the entire
population of the Ionic towns to the island of Sardinia. Nothing like
freedom, he urged, was now open to them in Asia; but in Sardinia,
one great Pan-Ionic city might be formed, which would not only be
free herself, but mistress of her neighbors. The proposition found no
favor; the reason of which is sufficiently evident from the narrative
just given respecting the unconquerable local attachment on the part
of the Phôkæan majority. But Herodotus bestows upon it the most
unqualified commendation, and regrets that it was not acted upon.<a
id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> Had
such been the case, the subsequent history of Carthage, Sicily, and
even Rome, might have been sensibly altered.</p>

<p>Thus subdued by Harpagus, the Ionic and Æolic Greeks were
employed as auxiliaries to him in the conquest of the south-western
inhabitants of Asia Minor,—Karians, Kaunians, Lykians, and Doric
Greeks of Knidus and Halikarnassus. Of the fate of the latter town,
Herodotus tells us nothing, though it was<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_208">[p. 208]</span> his native place. The inhabitants
of Knidus, a place situated on a long outlying tongue of land, at
first tried to cut through the narrow isthmus which joined them
to the continent, but abandoned the attempt with a facility which
Herodotus explains by referring it to a prohibition of the oracle:<a
id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> nor
did either the Karians or the Kaunians offer any serious resistance.
The Lykians only, in their chief town Xanthus, made a desperate
defence. Having in vain tried to repel the assailants in the open
field, and finding themselves blocked up in their city, they set
fire to it with their own hands; consuming in the flames their
women, children, and servants, while the armed citizens marched out
and perished to a man in combat with the enemy.<a id="FNanchor_365"
href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> Such an act of brave
and even ferocious despair is not in the Grecian character. In
recounting, however, the languid defence and easy submission of the
Greeks of Knidus, it may surprise us to call to mind that they were
Dorians and colonists from Sparta. So that the want of steadfast
courage, often imputed to Ionic Greeks as compared to Dorian, ought
properly to be charged on Asiatic Greeks as compared with European;
or rather upon that mixture of indigenous with Hellenic population,
which all the Asiatic colonies, in common with most of the other
colonies, presented, and which in Halikarnassus was particularly
remarkable; for it seems to have been half Karian, half Dorian, and
was even governed by a line of Karian despots.</p>

<p>Harpagus and the Persians thus mastered, without any considerable
resistance, the western and southern portions of Asia Minor;
probably, also, though we have no direct account of it, the entire
territory within the Halys which had before been ruled by Crœsus. The
tributes of the conquered Greeks were transmitted to Ekbatana instead
of to Sardis. While Harpagus was thus employed, Cyrus himself had
been making still more extensive conquests in Upper Asia and Assyria,
of which I shall speak in the coming chapter.</p>

    GROWTH OF THE PERSIAN EMPIRE.</h2>
</div>

<p class="mt1"><span class="smcap">In the</span> preceding chapter
an account has been given, the best which we can pick out from
Herodotus, of the steps by which the Asiatic Greeks became subject
to Persia. And if his narrative is meagre, on a matter which
vitally concerned not only so many of his brother Greeks, but even
his own native city, we can hardly expect that he should tell us
much respecting the other conquests of Cyrus. He seems to withhold
intentionally various details which had come to his knowledge, and
merely intimates in general terms that while Harpagus was engaged
on the coast of the Ægean, Cyrus himself assailed and subdued
all the nations of Upper Asia, “not omitting any one of them.”<a
id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a>
He alludes to the Baktrians and the Sakæ,<a id="FNanchor_367"
href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> who are also named
by Ktêsias as having become subject partly by force, partly by
capitulation; but he deems only two of the exploits of Cyrus worthy
of special notice,—the conquest of Babylon, and the final expedition
against the Massagetæ. In the short abstract which we now possess
of the lost work of Ktêsias, no mention appears of the important
conquest of Babylon; but his narrative, as far as the abstract
enables us to follow it, diverges materially from that of Herodotus,
and must have been founded on data altogether different.</p>

<p>“I shall mention (says Herodotus)<a id="FNanchor_368"
href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> those conquests which
gave Cyrus most trouble, and are most memorable: after he had subdued
all the rest of the continent, he attacked the Assyrians.” Those who
recollect the description of Babylon and its surrounding territory,
as given in a former chapter, will not be surprised to learn that the
capture of it gave the Persian aggressor much trouble: their only
surprise will be, how it could ever have been<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_210">[p. 210]</span> taken at all,—or, indeed, how a
hostile army could have even reached it. Herodotus informs us that
the Babylonian queen Nitôkris—mother of that very Labynêtus who was
king when Cyrus attacked the place—had been apprehensive of invasion
from the Medes after their capture of Nineveh, and had executed many
laborious works near the Euphratês for the purpose of obstructing
their approach. Moreover, there existed what was called the wall
of Media (probably built by her, but certainly built prior to the
Persian conquest), one hundred feet high and twenty feet thick,<a
id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a>
across the entire space of seventy-five miles which joined the
Tigris with one of the canals of the Euphratês. And the canals
themselves, as we may see by the march of the Ten Thousand Greeks
after the battle of Kunaxa, presented means of defence altogether
insuperable by a rude army such as that of the Persians. On the east,
the territory of Babylonia was defended by the Tigris, which cannot
be forded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[p. 211]</span> lower
than the ancient Nineveh or the modern Mosul.<a id="FNanchor_370"
href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> In addition to
these ramparts, natural as well as artificial, to protect the
territory,—populous, cultivated, productive, and offering every
motive to its inhabitants to resist even the entrance of an enemy,—we
are told that the Babylonians were so thoroughly prepared for the
inroad of Cyrus that they had accumulated a store of provisions
within the city walls for many years.</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem, we must suppose that the king of Babylon,
after all the cost and labor spent in providing defences for the
territory, voluntarily neglected to avail himself of them, suffered
the invader to tread down the fertile Babylonia without resistance,
and merely drew out the citizens to oppose him when he arrived under
the walls of the city,—if the statement of Herodotus is correct.<a
id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a>
And we may illustrate this unaccountable omission by that which we
know to have happened in the march of the younger Cyrus to Kunaxa
against his brother Artaxerxês Mnêmon. The latter had caused to
be dug, expressly in preparation for this invasion, a broad and
deep ditch, thirty feet wide and eight feet deep, from the wall
of Media to the river Euphratês, a distance of twelve parasangs,
or forty-live English miles, leaving only a passage of twenty
feet broad close alongside of the river. Yet when the invading
army arrived at this important pass, they found not a man there
to defend it, and all of them marched without resistance through
the narrow inlet. Cyrus the younger, who had up to that moment
felt assured that his brother would fight, now supposed that he
had given up the idea of defending Babylon:<a id="FNanchor_372"
href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> instead of which, two
days afterwards,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[p. 212]</span>
Artaxerxês attacked him on an open plain of ground, where there was
no advantage of position on either side; though the invaders were
taken rather unawares in consequence of their extreme confidence,
arising from recent unopposed entrance within the artificial
ditch.</p>

<p>This anecdote is the more valuable as an illustration, because all
its circumstances are transmitted to us by a discerning eye-witness.
And both the two incidents here brought into comparison demonstrate
the recklessness, changefulness, and incapacity of calculation,
belonging to the Asiatic mind of that day,—as well as the great
command of hands possessed by these kings, and their prodigal
waste of human labor.<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373"
class="fnanchor">[373]</a> We shall see, as we advance in this
history, farther evidences of the same attributes, which it is
essential to bear in mind, for the purpose of appreciating both
Grecian dealing with Asiatics, and the comparative absence of such
defects in the Grecian character. Vast walls and deep ditches are
an inestimable aid to a brave and well commanded garrison; but
they cannot be made entirely to supply the want of bravery and
intelligence.</p>

<p>In whatever manner the difficulties of approaching Babylon may
have been overcome, the fact that they were overcome by Cyrus is
certain. On first setting out for this conquest, he was about to
cross the river Gyndês (one of the affluents from the East which
joins the Tigris near the modern Bagdad, and along which lay
the high road crossing the pass of Mount Zagros from Babylon to
Ekbatana), when one of the sacred white horses, which accompanied
him, insulted the river<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374"
class="fnanchor">[374]</a> so far as to march in and try to cross
it by himself. The Gyndês resented this insult, and the horse was
drowned: upon which Cyrus swore in his wrath that he would so break
the strength of the river as that women in future should pass it
without wetting their knees. Accordingly, he employed his entire
army, during the whole summer season, in digging three hundred and
sixty artificial channels to disseminate the unity of the stream.
Such, accord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[p. 213]</span>ing
to Herodotus, was the incident which postponed for one year the fall
of the great Babylon; but in the next spring Cyrus and his army were
before the walls, after having defeated and driven in the population
who came out to fight. But the walls were artificial mountains (three
hundred feet high, seventy-five feet thick, and forming a square
of fifteen miles to each side), within which the besieged defied
attack, and even blockade, having previously stored up several years’
provision. Through the midst of these walls, however, flowed the
Euphratês; and this river, which had been so laboriously trained
to serve for protection, trade, and sustenance to the Babylonians,
was now made the avenue of their ruin. Having left a detachment of
his army at the two points where the Euphratês enters and quits
the city, Cyrus retired with the remainder to the higher part of
its course, where an ancient Babylonian queen had prepared one of
the great lateral reservoirs for carrying off in case of need the
superfluity of its water. Near this point Cyrus caused another
reservoir and another canal of communication to be dug, by means of
which he drew off the water of the Euphrates to such a decree that
it became not above the height of a man’s thigh. The period chosen
was that of a great Babylonian festival, when the whole population
were engaged in amusement and revelry; and the Persian troops left
near the town, watching their opportunity, entered from both sides
along the bed of the river, and took it by surprise with scarcely
any resistance. At no other time, except during a festival, could
they have done this, says Herodotus, had the river been ever so low;
for both banks throughout the whole length of the town were provided
with quays, with continuous walls, and with gates at the end of every
street which led down to the river at right angles: so that if the
population had not been disqualified by the influences of the moment,
they would have caught the assailants in the bed of the river “as a
trap,” and overwhelmed them from the walls alongside. Within a square
of fifteen miles to each side, we are not surprised to hear that both
the extremities were already in the power of the besiegers before
the central population heard of it, and while they were yet absorbed
in unconscious festivity.<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375"
class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[p. 214]</span>Such is
the account given by Herodotus of the circumstances which placed
Babylon—the greatest city of western Asia—in the power of the
Persians. To what extent the information communicated to him was
incorrect, or exaggerated, we cannot now decide; but the way in which
the city was treated would lead us to suppose that its acquisition
cannot have cost the conqueror either much time or much loss. Cyrus
comes into the list as king of Babylon, and the inhabitants with
their whole territory become tributary to the Persians, forming the
richest satrapy in the empire; but we do not hear that the people
were otherwise ill-used, and it is certain that the vast walls and
gates were left untouched. This was very different from the way in
which the Medes had treated Nineveh, which seems to have been ruined
and for a long time absolutely uninhabited, though reoccupied on a
reduced scale under the Parthian empire; and very different also from
the way in which Babylon itself was treated twenty years afterwards
by Darius, when reconquered after a revolt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[p. 215]</span>The importance
of Babylon, marking as it does one of the peculiar forms of
civilization belonging to the ancient world in a state of full
development, gives an interest even to the half-authenticated
stories respecting its capture; but the other exploits ascribed to
Cyrus,—his invasion of India, across the desert of Arachosia,<a
id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>—and
his attack upon the Massagetæ, nomads ruled by queen Tomyris, and
greatly resembling the Scythians, across the mysterious river which
Herodotus calls Araxês,—are too little known to be at all dwelt
upon. In the latter he is said to have perished, his army being
defeated in a bloody battle.<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377"
class="fnanchor">[377]</a> He was buried at Pasargadæ, in his
native province of Persis proper, where his tomb was honored and
watched until the breaking up of the empire,<a id="FNanchor_378"
href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> while his memory was
held in profound veneration among the Persians.</p>

<p>Of his real exploits, we know little except their results; but
in what we read respecting him there seems, though amidst constant
fighting, very little cruelty. Xenophon has selected his life as
the subject of a moral romance, which for a long time was cited
as authentic history, and which even now serves as an authority,
expressed or implied, for disputable and even incorrect conclusions.
His extraordinary activity and conquests admit of no doubt. He
left the Persian empire<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379"
class="fnanchor">[379]</a> extending from Sogdiana and the rivers
Jaxartês and Indus eastward, to the Hellespont and the Syrian coast
westward, and his successors made no permanent addition to it except
that of Egypt. Phenicia and Judæa were dependencies of Babylon,
at the time when he conquered it, with their princes and grandees
in Babylonian captivity. They seem to have yielded to him, and
become his tributaries,<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380"
class="fnanchor">[380]</a> without difficulty; and the restoration
of their captives was con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[p.
216]</span>ceded to them. It was from Cyrus that the habits of the
Persian kings took commencement, to dwell at Susa in the winter, and
Ekbatana during the summer; the primitive territory of Persis, with
its two towns of Persepolis and Pasargadæ, being reserved for the
burial-place of the kings and the religious sanctuary of the empire.
How or when the conquest of Susiana was made, we are not informed; it
lay eastward of the Tigris, between Babylonia and Persis proper, and
its people, the Kissians, as far as we can discern, were of Assyrian
and not of Arian race. The river Choaspês, near Susa, was supposed
to furnish the only water fit for the palate of the Great King, and
is said to have been carried about with him wherever he went.<a
id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>

<p>While the conquests of Cyrus contributed to assimilate the
distinct types of civilization in western Asia,—not by elevating
the worse, but by degrading the better,—upon the native Persians
themselves they operated as an extraordinary stimulus, provoking
alike their pride, ambition, cupidity, and warlike propensities.
Not only did the territory of Persis proper pay no tribute to
Susa or Ekbatana,—being the only district so exempted between the
Jaxartês and the Mediterranean,—but the vast tributes received
from the remaining empire were distributed to a great degree
among its inhabitants. Empire to them meant,—for the great men,
lucrative satrapies, or pachalics, with powers altogether unlimited,
pomp inferior only to that of the Great King, and standing
armies which they employed at their own discretion, sometimes
against each other,<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382"
class="fnanchor">[382]</a>—for the common soldiers, drawn from their
fields or flocks, constant plunder, abundant maintenance, and an
unrestrained license, either in the suite of one of the satraps, or
in the large permanent troop which moved from Susa to Ekbatana with
the Great King. And if the entire population of Persis proper did
not migrate from their abodes to occupy some of those more inviting
spots which the immensity of the imperial dominion furnished,—a
dominion extending (to use the language of Cyrus the younger, before
the battle of Kunaxa)<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383"
class="fnanchor">[383]</a> from the region of insupportable heat
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[p. 217]</span> that
of insupportable cold,—this was only because the early kings
discouraged such a movement, in order that the nation might maintain
its military hardihood,<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384"
class="fnanchor">[384]</a> and be in a situation to furnish
undiminished supplies of soldiers.</p>

<p>The self-esteem and arrogance of the Persians was no less
remarkable than their avidity for sensual enjoyment. They were
fond of wine to excess; their wives and their concubines were both
numerous; and they adopted eagerly from foreign nations new fashions
of luxury as well as of ornament. Even to novelties in religion,
they were not strongly averse; for though they were disciples
of Zoroaster, with magi as their priests, and as indispensable
companions of their sacrifices, worshipping Sun, Moon, Earth,
Fire, etc., and recognizing neither image, temple, nor altar,—yet
they had adopted the voluptuous worship of the goddess Mylitta
from the Assyrians and Arabians. A numerous male offspring was the
Persian’s boast, and his warlike character and consciousness of
force were displayed in the education of these youths, who were
taught, from five years old to twenty, only three things,—to ride,
to shoot with the bow, and to speak the truth.<a id="FNanchor_385"
href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> To owe money, or even
to buy and sell, was accounted among the Persians disgraceful,—a
sentiment which they defended by saying, that both the one and the
other imposed the necessity of telling falsehood. To exact tribute
from subjects, to receive pay or presents from the king, and to
give away without forethought whatever was not immediately wanted,
was their mode of dealing with money. Industrious pursuits were
left to the conquered, who were fortunate if by paying a fixed
contribution, and sending a military contingent when required, they
could purchase undisturbed immunity for their remaining concerns.<a
id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>
They could not thus purchase safety for the family<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[p. 218]</span> hearth, since we find
instances of noble Grecian maidens torn from their parents for
the harem of the satrap.<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387"
class="fnanchor">[387]</a></p>

<p>To a people of this character, whose conceptions of political
society went no farther than personal obedience to a chief, a
conqueror like Cyrus would communicate the strongest excitement
and enthusiasm of which they were capable. He had found them
slaves, and made them masters; he was the first and greatest of
national benefactors,<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388"
class="fnanchor">[388]</a> as well as the most forward of leaders in
the field; they followed him from one conquest to another, during
the thirty years of his reign, their love of empire growing with the
empire itself. And this impulse of aggrandizement continued unabated
during the reigns of his three next successors,—Kambysês, Darius, and
Xerxês,—until it was at length violently stifled by the humiliating
defeats of Platæa and Salamis; after which the Persians became
content with defending themselves at home, and playing a secondary
game. But at the time when Kambysês son of Cyrus succeeded to his
father’s sceptre, Persian spirit was at its highest point, and he
was not long in fixing upon a prey both richer and less hazardous
than the Massagetæ, at the opposite extremity of the empire. Phenicia
and Judæa being already subject to him, he resolved to invade Egypt,
then highly flourishing under the long and prosperous reign of
Amasis. Not much pretence was needed to color the aggression, and
the various stories which Herodotus mentions as causes of the war,
are only interesting inasmuch as they imply a vein of Egyptian party
feeling,—affirming that the invasion was brought upon Amasis by a
daughter of Apriês, and was thus a judgment upon him for having
deposed the latter. As to the manner in which she had produced this
effect, indeed, the most contradictory stories were circulated.<a
id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>

<p>Kambysês summoned the forces of his empire for this new
enterprise, and among them both the Phenicians and the Asiatic<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[p. 219]</span> Greeks, Æolic
as well as Ionic,<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390"
class="fnanchor">[390]</a> insular as well as continental,—nearly
all the maritime force and skill of the Ægean sea. He was apprized
by a Greek deserter from the mercenaries in Egypt, named Phanês, of
the difficulties of the march, and the best method of surmounting
them; especially the three days of sandy desert, altogether without
water, which lay between Egypt and Judæa. By the aid of the
neighboring Arabians,—with whom he concluded a treaty, and who were
requited for this service with the title of equal allies, free from
all tribute,—he was enabled to surmount this serious difficulty,
and to reach Pelusium at the eastern mouth of the Nile, where the
Ionian and Karian troops in the Egyptian service, as well as the
Egyptian military, were assembled to oppose him.<a id="FNanchor_391"
href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a></p>

<p>Fortunately for himself, the Egyptian king Amasis had died during
the interval of the Persian preparations, a few months before the
expedition took place,—after forty-four years of unabated prosperity.
His death, at this critical moment, was probably the main cause of
the easy conquest which followed; his son Psammenitus succeeding
to his crown, but neither to his abilities nor his influence. The
result of the invasion was foreshadowed, as usual, by a menacing
prodigy,—rain falling at Thebes in Upper Egypt; and was brought about
by a single victory, though bravely disputed, at Pelusium,—followed
by the capture of Memphis, with the person of king Psammenitus, after
a siege of some duration. Kambysês had sent forward a Mitylenæan ship
to Memphis, with heralds to summon the city; but the Egyptians, in
a paroxysm of fury, rushed out of the walls, destroyed the vessel,
and tore the crew into pieces,—a savage proceeding, which drew
upon them severe retribution after the capture. Psammenitus, after
being at first treated with harshness and insult, was at length
released, and even allowed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[p.
220]</span> retain his regal dignity as a dependent of Persia. But
being soon detected, or at least believed to be concerned, in raising
revolt against the conquerors, he was put to death, and Egypt was
placed under a satrap.<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392"
class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<p>There yet lay beyond Egypt territories for Kambysês to
conquer,—though Kyrênê and Barka, the Greek colonies near the coast
of Libya, placed themselves at once out of the reach of danger by
sending to him tribute and submission at Memphis. He projected
three new enterprises: one against Carthage, by sea; the other
two, by land, against the Ethiopians, far to the southward up the
course of the Nile, and against the oracle and oasis of Zeus Ammon,
amidst the deserts of Libya. Towards Ethiopia he himself conducted
his troops, but was compelled to bring them back without reaching
it, since they were on the point of perishing with famine; while
the division which he sent against the temple of Ammon is said to
have been overwhelmed by a sand-storm in the desert. The expedition
against Carthage was given up, for a reason which well deserves to
be commemorated. The Phenicians, who formed the most efficient part
of his navy, refused to serve against their kinsmen and colonists,
pleading the sanctity of mutual oaths as well as the ties both of
relationship and traffic.<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393"
class="fnanchor">[393]</a> Even the frantic Kambysês was compelled to
accept, and perhaps to respect, this honorable refusal, which was not
imitated by the Ionic Greeks when Darius and Xerxês demanded the aid
of their ships against Athens,—we must add, however, that they were
then in a situation much more exposed and helpless than that in which
the Phenicians stood before Kambysês.</p>

<p>Among the sacred animals so numerous and so different throughout
the various nomes of Egypt, the most venerated of all was the bull
Apis. Yet such peculiar conditions were required by the Egyptian
religion as to the birth, the age, and the marks of this animal,
that, when he died, it was difficult to find a new calf properly
qualified to succeed him. Much time was sometimes spent in the
search, and when an unexceptionable suc<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_221">[p. 221]</span>cessor was at last found, the
demonstrations of joy in Memphis were extravagant and universal.
At the moment when Kambysês returned to Memphis from his Ethiopian
expedition, full of humiliation for the result, it so happened that a
new Apis was just discovered; and as the population of the city gave
vent to their usual festival pomp and delight, he construed it into
an intentional insult towards his own recent misfortunes. In vain did
the priests and magistrates explain to him the real cause of these
popular manifestations; he persisted in his belief, punished some
of them with death and others with stripes, and commanded every man
seen in holiday attire to be slain. Furthermore,—to carry his outrage
against Egyptian feeling to the uttermost pitch,—he sent for the
newly-discovered Apis, and plunged his dagger into the side of the
animal, who shortly afterwards died of the wound.<a id="FNanchor_394"
href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a></p>

<p>After this brutal deed,—calculated to efface in the minds of the
Egyptian priests the enormities of Cheops and Chephrên, and doubtless
unparalleled in all the twenty-four thousand years of their anterior
history,—Kambysês lost every spark of reason which yet remained to
him, and the Egyptians found in this visitation a new proof of the
avenging interference of their gods. Not only did he commit every
variety of studied outrage against the conquered people among whom
he was tarrying, as well as their temples and their sepulchres,—but
he also dealt his blows against his Persian friends and even his
nearest blood-relations. Among these revolting atrocities, one of the
greatest deserves peculiar notice, because the fate of the empire was
afterwards materially affected by it. His younger brother Smerdis had
accompanied him into Egypt, but had been sent back to Susa, because
the king became jealous of the admiration which his personal strength
and qualities called forth.<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395"
class="fnanchor">[395]</a> That jealousy was aggravated into
alarm and hatred by a dream, portending dominion and conquest to
Smerdis; so that the frantic Kambysês sent to<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_222">[p. 222]</span> Susa secretly a confidential Persian,
Prexaspês, with express orders to get rid of his brother. Prexaspês
fulfilled his commission effectively, burying the slain prince
with his own hands,<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396"
class="fnanchor">[396]</a> and keeping the deed concealed from all
except a few of the chiefs at the regal residence.</p>

<p>Among these few chiefs, however, there was one, the Median
Patizeithês, belonging to the order of the Magi, who saw in it
a convenient stepping-stone for his own personal ambition, and
made use of it as a means of covertly supplanting the dynasty of
the great Cyrus. Enjoying the full confidence of Kambysês, he had
been left by that prince, on departing for Egypt, in the entire
management of the palace and treasures, with extensive authority.<a
id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>
Moreover, he happened to have a brother extremely resembling in
person the deceased Smerdis; and as the open and dangerous madness
of Kambysês contributed to alienate from him the minds of the
Persians, he resolved to proclaim this brother king in his room, as
if it were the younger son of Cyrus succeeding to the disqualified
elder. On one important point, the false Smerdis differed from the
true. He had lost his ears, which Cyrus himself had caused to be
cut off for an offence; but the personal resemblance, after all,
was of little importance, since he was seldom or never allowed to
show himself to the people.<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398"
class="fnanchor">[398]</a> Kambysês, having heard of this revolt
in Syria on his return from Egypt, was mounting his horse in haste
for the purpose of going to suppress it, when an accident from his
sword put an end to his life. Herodotus tells us that, before his
death, he summoned the Persians around him, confessed that he had
been guilty of putting his brother to death, and apprized them that
the reigning Smerdis was only a Median pretender,—conjuring them
at the same time not to submit to the disgrace of being ruled by
any other than a Persian and an Achæmenid. But if it be true that
he ever made known the facts, no one believed him. For Prexaspês,
on his part, was compelled by regard to his own safety, to deny
that he had imbrued his hands in the blood<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_223">[p. 223]</span> of a son of Cyrus;<a id="FNanchor_399"
href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> and thus the
opportune death of Kambysês placed the false Smerdis without
opposition at the head of the Persians, who all, or for the most
part, believed themselves to be ruled by a genuine son of Cyrus.
Kambysês had reigned for seven years and five months.</p>

<p>For seven months did Smerdis reign without opposition, seconded
by his brother Patizeithês; and if he manifested his distrust of
the haughty Persians around him, by neither inviting them into his
palace nor showing himself out of it, he at the same time studiously
conciliated the favor of the subject provinces, by remission of
tribute and of military service for three years.<a id="FNanchor_400"
href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> Such a departure
from the Persian principle of government was in itself sufficient
to disgust the warlike and rapacious Achæmenids at Susa. But it
seems that their suspicions as to his genuine character had never
been entirely set at rest, and in the eighth month those suspicions
were converted into certainty. According to what seems to have been
the Persian usage, he had taken to himself the entire harem of
his predecessor, among whose wives was numbered Phædymê, daughter
of a distinguished Persian, named Otanês. At the instance of her
father, Phædymê undertook the dangerous task of feeling the head of
Smerdis while he slept, and thus detected the absence of ears.<a
id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a>
Otanês, possessed of the decisive information, lost no time in
concerting, with five other noble Achæmenids, means for ridding
themselves of a king who was at once a Mede, a Magian, and a
man without ears;<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402"
class="fnanchor">[402]</a> Darius, son of Hystaspês, the satrap
of Persis proper, arriving just in time to join the conspiracy as
the seventh. How these seven noblemen slew Smerdis in his palace
at Susa,—how they subsequently debated among themselves whether
they should establish in Persia a monarchy, an oligarchy, or a
democracy,—how, after the first of the three had been resolved upon,
it was determined that the future king, whichever he might be, should
be bound to take his wives only from the families of the seven
con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[p. 224]</span>spirators,—how
Darius became king, from the circumstance of his horse being the
first to neigh among those of the conspirators at a given spot,
by the stratagem of the groom Œbarês,—how Otanês, standing aside
beforehand from this lottery for the throne, reserved for himself
as well as for his descendants perfect freedom and exemption from
the rule of the future king, whichsoever might draw the prize,—all
these incidents may be found recounted by Herodotus with his usual
vivacity, but with no small addition of Hellenic ideas as well as of
dramatic ornament.</p>

<p>It was thus that the upright tiara, the privileged head-dress
of the Persian kings,<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403"
class="fnanchor">[403]</a> passed away from the lineage of Cyrus,
yet without departing from the great phratry of the Achæmenidæ,—to
which Darius and his father Hystaspês, as well as Cyrus, belonged.
That important fact is unquestionable, and probably the acts
ascribed to the seven conspirators are in the main true, apart from
their discussions and intentions. But on this as well as on other
occasions, we must guard ourselves against an illusion which the
historical manner of Herodotus is apt to create. He presents to us
with so much descriptive force the personal narrative,—individual
action and speech, with all its accompanying hopes, fears, doubts,
and passions,—that our attention is distracted from the political
bearing of what is going on; which we are compelled often to gather
up from hints in the speeches of performers, or from consequences
afterwards indirectly noticed. When we put together all the
incidental notices which he lets drop, it will be found that the
change of sceptre from Smerdis to Darius was a far larger political
event than his direct narrative would seem to announce. Smerdis
represents preponderance to the Medes over the Persians, and
comparative degradation to the latter; who, by the installation of
Darius, are again placed in the ascendent. The Medes and the Magians
are in this case identical; for the Magians, though indispensable
in the capacity of priests to the Persians, were essentially
one of the seven Median<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[p.
225]</span> tribes.<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404"
class="fnanchor">[404]</a> It thus appears that though Smerdis
ruled as a son of the great Cyrus, yet he ruled by means of Medes
and Magians, depriving the Persians of that supreme privilege and
predominance to which they had become accustomed.<a id="FNanchor_405"
href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> We see this by what
followed immediately after the assassination of Smerdis and his
brother in the palace. The seven conspirators, exhibiting the bloody
heads of both these victims as an evidence of their deed, instigated
the Persians in Susa to a general massacre of the Magians, many
of whom were actually slain, and the rest only escaped by flight,
concealment, or the hour of night. And the anniversary of this day
was celebrated afterwards among the Persians by a solemnity and
festival, called the Magophonia; no Magian being ever allowed on that
day to appear in public.<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406"
class="fnanchor">[406]</a> The descendants of the Seven maintained a
privileged name and rank,<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407"
class="fnanchor">[407]</a> even down to the extinction of the
monarchy by Alexander the Great.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[p. 226]</span>Furthermore,
it appears that the authority of Darius was not readily acknowledged
throughout the empire, and that an interval of confusion ensued
before it became so.<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408"
class="fnanchor">[408]</a> The Medes actually revolted, and tried
to maintain themselves by force against Darius, who however
found means to subdue them: though, when he convoked his troops
from the various provinces, he did not receive from the satraps
universal obedience. The powerful Orœtês, especially, who had been
appointed by Cyrus satrap of Lydia and Ionia, not only sent no
troops to the aid of Darius against the Medes,<a id="FNanchor_409"
href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> but even took
advantage of the disturbed state of the government to put to death
his private enemy Mitrobatês satrap of Phrygia, and appropriate that
satrapy in addition to his own. Aryandês also, the satrap nominated
by Kambysês in Egypt, comported himself as the equal of Darius
rather than as his subject.<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410"
class="fnanchor">[410]</a> The subject provinces generally, to whom
Smerdis had granted remission of tribute and military service for
the space of three years, were grateful and attached to his memory,
and noway pleased with the new dynasty; moreover, the revolt of
the Babylonians, conceived a year or two before it was executed,
took its rise from the feelings of this time.<a id="FNanchor_411"
href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> But the renewal of
the old conflict between the two principal sections of the empire,
Medes and Persians, is doubtless the most important feature in this
political revolution. The false Smerdis with his brother, both of
them Medes and Magians, had revived the Median nationality to a
state of supremacy over the Persian, recalling the memory of what
it had been under Astyagês; while Darius,—a pure Persian, and not
(like the mule Cyrus) half Mede and half Persian,—replaced the
Persian nationality in its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[p.
227]</span> ascendent condition, though not without the necessity of
suppressing by force a rebellion of the Medes.<a id="FNanchor_412"
href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[p. 228]</span>It has already
been observed that the subjugation of the recusant Medes was not
the only embarrassment of the first years of<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_229">[p. 229]</span> Darius. Orœtês, satrap of Phrygia,
Lydia, and Ionia, ruling seemingly the entire western coast of Asia
Minor,—possessing a large military force and revenue, and surrounded
by a body-guard of one thousand native Persians,—maintained a haughty
independence. He secretly made away with couriers sent to summon him
to Susa, and even wreaked his vengeance upon some of the principal
Persians who had privately offended him.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_230">[p. 230]</span> Darius, not thinking it prudent to
attack him by open force, proposed to the chief Persians at Susa,
the dangerous problem of destroying him by stratagem. Thirty among
them volunteered to undertake it, and Bagæus, son of Artontês,
to whom on drawing lots the task devolved, accomplished it by a
manœuvre which might serve as a lesson to the Ottoman government,
in its embarrassments with contumacious Pashas. Having proceeded to
Sardis, furnished with many different royal ordinances, formally set
forth and bearing the seal of Darius,—he was presented to Orœtês in
audience, with the public secretary of the satrapy close at hand, and
the Persian guards standing around. He presented his ordinances to
be read aloud by the secretary, choosing first those which related
to matters of no great importance; but when he saw that the guards
listened with profound reverence, and that the king’s name and seal
imposed upon them irresistibly, he ventured upon the real purport of
his perilous mission. An ordinance was handed to the secretary, and
read by him aloud, as follows: “Persians, king Darius forbids you to
serve any longer as guards to Orœtês.” The obedient guards at once
delivered up their spears, when Bagæus caused the final warrant to be
read to them: “King Darius commands the Persians in Sardis to kill
Orœtês.” The guards drew their swords and killed him on the spot: his
large treasure was conveyed to Susa: Darius became undisputed master,
and probably Bagæus satrap.<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413"
class="fnanchor">[413]</a></p>

<p>Another devoted adherent, and another yet more memorable piece
of cunning, laid prostrate before Darius the mighty walls and
gates of the revolted Babylon. The inhabitants of that city had
employed themselves assiduously,—both during the lax provincial
superintendence of the false Smerdis, and during the period of
confusion and conflict which elapsed before Darius became firmly
established and obeyed,—in making every preparation both for
declaring and sustaining their independence. Having accumulated a
large store of provisions and other requisites for a long siege,
without previous detection, they at length proclaimed their
independence openly. And such was the intensity of their resolution
to maintain it, that they had recourse to a proceeding, which,
if correctly reported by Herodotus, forms<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_231">[p. 231]</span> one of the most frightful enormities
recorded in his history. To make their provisions last out longer,
they strangled all the women in the city, reserving only their
mothers, and one woman to each family for the purpose of baking.<a
id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> We
cannot but suppose that this has been magnified from a partial into
an universal destruction. Yet taking it even with such allowance, it
illustrates that ferocious force of will,—and that predominance of
strong nationality, combined with antipathy to foreigners, over all
the gentler sympathies,—which seems to mark the Semitic nations, and
which may be traced so much in the Jewish history of Josephus.</p>

<p>Darius, assembling all the forces in his power, laid siege to
the revolted city, but could make no impression upon it, either by
force or by stratagem. He tried to repeat the proceeding by which
Cyrus had taken it at first; but the besieged were found this time
on their guard. The siege had lasted twenty months without the
smallest progress, and the Babylonians derided the besiegers from
the height of their impregnable walls, when a distinguished Persian
nobleman Zopyrus,—son of Megabyzus, who had been one of the seven
conspirators against Smerdis,—presented himself one day before Darius
in a state of frightful mutilation: his nose and ears were cut off,
and his body misused in every way. He had designedly so maimed
himself, “thinking it intolerable that Assyrians should thus laugh
the Persians to scorn,”<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415"
class="fnanchor">[415]</a> in the intention which he presently
intimated to Darius, of passing into the town as a deserter, with a
view of betraying it,—for which purpose measures were concerted. The
Babylonians, seeing a Persian of the highest rank in so calamitous
a condition, readily believed his assurance, that he had been thus
punished by the king’s order, and that he came over to them as the
only means of procuring for himself single vengeance. They intrusted
him with the command of a detachment, with which he gained several
advantages in different sallies, according to previous concert
with Darius, until at length, the confidence of the Babylonians
becom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[p. 232]</span>ing
unbounded, they placed in his hands the care of the principal gates.
At the critical moment these gates were thrown open, and the Persians
became masters of the city.<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416"
class="fnanchor">[416]</a></p>

<p>Thus was the impregnable Babylon a second time reduced,<a
id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>
and Darius took precautions on this occasion to put it out of
condition for resisting a third time. He caused the walls and gates
to be demolished, and three thousand of the principal citizens to
be crucified: the remaining inhabitants were left in the dismantled
city, fifty thousand women being levied by assessment upon the
neighboring provinces, to supply the place of the women strangled
when it first revolted.<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418"
class="fnanchor">[418]</a> Zopyrus was ap<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_233">[p. 233]</span>pointed satrap of the territory for
life, with enjoyment of its entire revenues, receiving besides every
additional reward which it was in the power of Darius to bestow,
and generous assurances from the latter that he would rather have
Zopyrus without wounds than the possession of Babylon. I have already
intimated in a former chapter that the demolition of the walls here
mentioned is not to be regarded as complete and continuous, nor was
there any necessity that it should be so. Partial demolition would
be quite sufficient to leave the city without defence; and the
description given by Herodotus of the state of things as they stood
at the time of his visit, proves that portions of the walls yet
subsisted. One circumstance is yet to be added in reference to the
subsequent condition of Babylon under the Persian empire. The city
with the territory belonging to it constituted a satrapy, which not
only paid a larger tribute (one thousand Euboic talents of silver)
and contributed a much larger amount of provisions in kind for the
maintenance of the Persian court, than any other among the twenty
satrapies of the empire, but furnished besides an annual supply of
five hundred eunuch youths.<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419"
class="fnanchor">[419]</a> We may presume that this was intended in
part as a punishment for the past revolt, since the like obligation
was not imposed upon any other satrapy.</p>

<p>Thus firmly established on the throne, Darius occupied it
for thirty-six years, and his reign was one of organization,
different from that of his two predecessors; a difference which
the Persians well understood and noted, calling Cyrus the father,
Kambysês the master, and Darius the retail-trader, or huckster.<a
id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a>
In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[p. 234]</span> the mouth
of the Persians this latter epithet must be construed as no
insignificant compliment, since it intimates that he was the first to
introduce some methodical order into the imperial administration and
finances. Under the two former kings there was no definite amount of
tribute levied upon the subject provinces: which furnished what were
called presents, subject to no fixed limit except such as might be
satisfactory to the satrap in each district. But Darius—succeeding
as he did to Smerdis, who had rendered himself popular with the
provinces by large financial exemptions, and having farther to
encounter jealousy and dissatisfaction from Persians, his former
equals in rank—probably felt it expedient to relieve the provinces
from the burden of undefined exactions. He distributed the whole
empire into twenty departments, imposing upon each a fixed annual
tax, and a fixed contribution for the maintenance of the court. This
must doubtless have been a great improvement, though the limitation
of the sum which the Great King at Susa would require, did not at all
prevent the satrap in his own province from indefinite requisitions
beyond it. The latter was a little king, who acted nearly as he
pleased in the internal administration of his province,—subject only
to the necessity of sending up the imperial tribute, of keeping off
foreign enemies, and of furnishing an adequate military contingent
for the foreign enterprises of the Great King. To every satrap
was attached a royal secretary, or comptroller, of the revenue,<a
id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a>
who probably managed the imperial finances in the province, and to
whom the court of Susa might perhaps look as a watch upon the satrap
himself. It is not to be supposed that the Persian authorities in
any province meddled with the details of taxation, or contribution,
as they bore upon individuals. The court having fixed the entire
sum payable by the satrapy in the aggregate, the satrap or the
secre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[p. 235]</span>tary
apportioned it among the various component districts, towns, or
provinces, leaving to the local authorities in each of these latter
the task of assessing it upon individual inhabitants. From necessity,
therefore, as well as from indolence of temper and political
incompetence, the Persians were compelled to respect authorities
which they found standing both in town and country, and to leave
in their hands a large measure of genuine influence; frequently
overruled, indeed, by oppressive interference on the part of the
satrap, whenever any of his passions prompted,—but never entirely
superseded. In the important towns and stations, Persian garrisons
were usually kept, and against the excesses of the military there
was probably little or no protection to the subject people. Yet
still, the provincial governments were allowed to continue, and often
even the petty kings who had governed separate districts during
their state of independence prior to the Persian conquest, retained
their title and dignity as tributaries to the court of Susa.<a
id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a>
The empire of the Great King was thus an aggregate of heterogeneous
elements, connected together by no tie except that of common fear
and subjection,—noway coherent nor self-supporting, nor pervaded
by any common system or spirit of nationality. It resembled, in
its main political features, the Turkish and Persian empires
of the present day,<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423"
class="fnanchor">[423]</a> though distinguished materially by the
many differences arising out of Mohammedanism and Christianity, and
apparently not reaching the same extreme of rapacity, corruption, and
cruelty in detail.</p>

<p>Darius distributed the Persian empire into twenty satrapies, each
including a certain continuous territory, and one or more nations
inhabiting it, the names of which Herodotus sets forth. The amount
of tribute payable by each satrapy was determined: payable in gold,
according to the Euboic talent, by the Indians in the easternmost
satrapy,—in silver, according to the Babylonian, or larger talent,
by the remaining nineteen. Herodotus computes the ratio of gold to
silver as 13&nbsp;:&nbsp;1. From the nineteen satrapies which paid in silver,
there was levied annually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[p.
236]</span> the sum of seven thousand seven hundred and forty
Babylonian talents, equal to something about two million nine
hundred and sixty-four thousand pounds sterling: from the Indians,
who alone paid in gold, there was received a sum equal (at the
rate of 1&nbsp;:&nbsp;13) to four thousand six hundred and eighty Euboic
talents of silver, or to about one million two hundred and ninety
thousand pounds sterling.<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424"
class="fnanchor">[424]</a></p>

<p>To explain how it happened that this one satrapy was charged
with a sum equal to two-fifths of the aggregate charge on the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[p. 237]</span> other nineteen,
Herodotus dwells upon the vast population, the extensive territory,
and the abundant produce in gold, among those whom he calls
Indians,—the easternmost inhabitants of the earth, since beyond them
there was nothing but uninhabitable sand,—reaching, as far as we can
make it out, from Baktria southward along the Indus to its mouth,
but how far eastward we cannot determine. Darius is said to have
undertaken an expedition against them and subdued them: moreover,
he is affirmed to have constructed and despatched vessels down the
Indus, from the city of Kaspatyri and the territory of the Paktyes,
in its upper regions, all the way down to its mouth: then into the
Indian ocean, round the peninsula of Arabia, and up the Red Sea
to Egypt. The ships were commanded by Skylax,—a Greek of Karyanda
on the south-western coast of Asia Minor;<a id="FNanchor_425"
href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> who, if this
statement be correct, executed a scheme of nautical enterprise
not only one hundred and seventy years earlier, but also far more
extensive, than the famous voyage of Nearchus, admiral of Alexander
the Great,—since the latter only went from the Indus to the Persian
gulf. The eastern portions of the Persian empire remained so unknown
and unvisited until the Macedonian invasion, that we are unable to
criticize these isolated statements of Herodotus. None of the Persian
kings subsequent to Darius appear to have visited them, and whether
the prodigious sum demandable from them according to the Persian
rent-roll was ever regularly levied, may reasonably be doubted. At
the same time, we may reasonably believe that the mountains in the
northern parts of Persian India—Cabul and Little Thibet—were at that
time extremely productive in gold, and that quantities of that metal,
such as now appear almost fabulous, may have been often obtained.
It appears that the produce of gold in all parts of the earth, as
far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[p. 238]</span> as hitherto
known, is obtained exclusively near the surface; so that a country
once rich in that metal may well have been exhausted of its whole
supply, and left at a later period without any gold at all.</p>

<p>Of the nineteen silver-paying satrapies, the most heavily
imposed was Babylonia, which paid one thousand talents: the next in
amount of charge was Egypt, paying seven hundred talents, besides
the produce of the fish from the lake of Mœris. The remaining
satrapies varied in amount, down as low as one hundred and seventy
talents, which was the sum charged on the seventh satrapy (in the
enumeration of Herodotus), comprising the Sattagydæ, the Gandarii,
the Dodikæ, and the Aparytæ. The Ionians, Æolians, Magnesians on
the Mæander, and on Mount Sipylus, Karians, Lykians, Milyans, and
Pamphylians,—including the coast of Asia Minor, southward of Kanê,
and from thence round the southern promontory to Phasêlis,—were rated
as one division, paying four hundred talents. But we may be sure
that much more than this was really taken from the people, when we
read that Magnesia alone afterwards paid to Themistoklês a revenue
of fifty talents annually.<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426"
class="fnanchor">[426]</a> The Mysians and Lydians were included,
with some others, in another division, and the Hellespontine Greeks
in a third, with Phrygians, Bithynians, Paphlagonians, Mariandynians,
and Syrians, paying three hundred and sixty talents,—nearly the same
as was paid by Syria proper, Phenicia, and Judæa, with the island of
Cyprus. Independent of this regular tribute, and the undefined sums
extorted over and above it,<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427"
class="fnanchor">[427]</a> there were some dependent nations,
which, though exempt from tribute, furnished occasional sums called
presents; and farther contributions were exacted for the maintenance
of the vast suite who always personally attended the king. One entire
third of this last burden was borne by Babylonia alone in consequence
of its exuberant fertility.<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428"
class="fnanchor">[428]</a> It was paid in produce, as indeed the
peculiar productions of every part of the empire seem to have been
sent up for the regal consumption.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[p. 239]</span>However
imperfectly we are now able to follow the geographical distribution
of the subject nations as given by Herodotus, it is extremely
valuable as the only professed statistics remaining, of the entire
Persian empire. The arrangement of satrapies, which he describes,
underwent modification in subsequent times; at least it does not
harmonize with various statements in the Anabasis of Xenophon, and
in other authors who recount Persian affairs belonging to the fourth
century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> But we find in no other author except
Herodotus any entire survey and distribution of the empire. It is,
indeed, a new tendency which now manifests itself in the Persian
Darius, compared with his predecessors: not simply to conquer,
to extort, and to give away,—but to do all this with something
like method and system,<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429"
class="fnanchor">[429]</a> and to define the obligations of the
satraps towards Susa. Another remarkable example of the same tendency
is to be found in the fact, that Darius was the first Persian king
who coined money: his coin, both in gold and silver, the Daric,
was the earliest produce of a Persian mint.<a id="FNanchor_430"
href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> The revenue, as
brought to Susa in metallic money of various descriptions, was
melted down separately, and poured in a fluid state into jars or
earthenware vessels; when the metal had cooled and hardened, the
jar was broken, leaving a standing solid mass, from which portions
were cut off as the oc<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[p.
240]</span>casion required.<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431"
class="fnanchor">[431]</a> And in addition to these administrative,
financial, and monetary arrangements, of which Darius was the first
originator, we may probably ascribe to him the first introduction
of that system of roads, resting-places, and permanent relays of
couriers, which connected both Susa and Ekbatana with the distant
portions of the empire. Herodotus describes in considerable detail
the imperial road from Sardis to Susa, a journey of ninety days,
crossing the Halys, the Euphratês, the Tigris, the Greater and
Lesser Zab, the Gyndês, and the Choaspês. And we may see by this
account that in his time it was kept in excellent order, with
convenience for travellers.<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432"
class="fnanchor">[432]</a></p>

<p>It was Darius also who first completed the conquest of the Ionic
Greeks by the acquisition of the important island of Samos. That
island had maintained its independence, at the time when the Persian
general Harpagus effected the conquest of Ionia. It did not yield
voluntarily when Chios and Lesbos submitted, and the Persians had
no fleet to attack it; nor had the Phenicians yet been taught to
round the Triopian cape. Indeed, the depression which overtook the
other cities of Ionia, tended rather to the aggrandizement of Samos,
under the energetic and unscrupulous despotism of Polykratês. That
ambitious Samian, about ten years after the conquest of Sardis by
Cyrus (seemingly between 536-532 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), contrived
to seize by force or fraud the government of his native island,
with the aid of his brothers Pantagnôtus and Sylosôn, and a small
band of conspirators.<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433"
class="fnanchor">[433]</a> At first, the three brothers shared the
supreme power; but presently Polykratês put to death Pantagnôtus,
banished Sylosôn, and made himself despot alone. In this station,
his ambition, his perfidy, and his good fortune, were alike
remarkable. He con<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[p.
241]</span>quered several of the neighboring islands, and even
some towns on the mainland; he carried on successful war against
Milêtus; and signally defeated the Lesbian ships which came to
assist Milêtus; he got together a force of one hundred armed ships
called pentekonters, and one thousand mercenary bowmen,—aspiring to
nothing less than the dominion of Ionia, with the islands in the
Ægean. Alike terrible to friend and foe by his indiscriminate spirit
of aggression, he acquired a naval power which seems at that time
to have been the greatest in the Grecian world.<a id="FNanchor_434"
href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> He had been in
intimate alliance with Amasis, king of Egypt, who, however,
ultimately broke with him. Considering his behavior towards allies,
such rupture is not at all surprising; but Herodotus ascribes it to
the alarm which Amasis conceived at the uninterrupted and superhuman
good fortune of Polykratês,—a degree of good fortune sure to draw
down ultimately corresponding intensity of suffering from the hands
of the envious gods. Indeed, Herodotus,—deeply penetrated with
this belief in an ever-present nemesis, which allows no man to be
very happy, or long happy, with impunity,—throws it into the form
of an epistolary warning from Amasis to Polykratês, advising him
to inflict upon himself some seasonable mischief or suffering; in
order, if possible, to avert the ultimate judgment,—to let blood in
time, so that the plethora of happiness might not end in apoplexy.<a
id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a>
Pursuant to such counsel, Polykratês threw into the sea a favorite
ring, of matchless price and beauty; but unfortunately, in a few
days, the ring reappeared in the belly of a fine fish, which a
fisherman had sent to him as a present. Amasis now foresaw that
the final apoplexy was inevitable, and broke off the alliance with
Polykratês without delay,—a well-known story, interesting as evidence
of ancient belief, and not less to be noted as showing the power of
that belief to beget fictitious details out of real characters, such
as I have already touched upon in the history of Solon and Crœsus,
and elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[p. 242]</span>The facts
mentioned by Herodotus rather lead us to believe that it was
Polykratês, who, with characteristic faithlessness, broke off his
friendship with Amasis;<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436"
class="fnanchor">[436]</a> finding it suitable to his policy to
cultivate the alliance of Kambysês, when that prince was preparing
for his invasion of Egypt. In that invasion, the Ionic subjects of
Persia were called upon to serve, and Polykratês, deeming it a good
opportunity to rid himself of some Samian malcontents, sent to the
Persian king to tender auxiliaries from himself. Kambysês, having
eagerly caught at the prospect of aid from the first naval potentate
in the Ægean, forty Samian triremes were sent to the Nile, having on
board the suspected persons, as well as conveying a secret request to
the Persian king that they might never be suffered to return. Either
they never went to Egypt, however, or they found means to escape;
very contradictory stories had reached Herodotus. But they certainly
returned to Samos, attacked Polykratês at home, and were driven
off by his superior force without making any impression. Whereupon
they repaired to Sparta to entreat assistance.<a id="FNanchor_437"
href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a></p>

<p>We may here notice the gradually increasing tendency in the
Grecian world to recognize Sparta as something like a head,
protector, or referee, in cases either of foreign danger or internal
dispute. The earliest authentic instance known to us, of application
to Sparta in this character, is that of Crœsus against Cyrus: next,
that of the Ionic Greeks against the latter: the instance of the
Samians now before us, is the third. The important events connected
with, and consequent upon, the expulsion of the Peisistratidæ from
Athens, manifesting yet more formally the headship of Sparta, occur
fifteen years after the present event; they have been already
recounted in a previous chapter, and serve as a farther proof of
progress in the same direction. To watch the growth of these new
political habits, is essential to a right understanding of Grecian
history.</p>

<p>On reaching Sparta, the Samian exiles, borne down with despondency
and suffering, entered at large into the particulars of their
case. Their long speaking annoyed instead of moving the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[p. 243]</span> Spartans, who said, or
are made to say: “We have forgotten the first part of the speech,
and the last part is unintelligible to us.” Upon which the Samians
appeared the next day, simply with an empty wallet, saving: “Our
wallet has no meal in it.” “Your wallet is superfluous,” (said the
Spartans;) <i>i. e.</i> the words would have been sufficient without it.<a
id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> The
aid which they implored was granted.</p>

<p>We are told that both the Lacedæmonians and the Corinthians,—who
joined them in the expedition now contemplated,—had separate grounds
of quarrel with the Samians,<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439"
class="fnanchor">[439]</a> which operated as a more powerful motive
than the simple desire to aid the suffering exiles. But it rather
seems that the subsequent Greeks generally construed the Lacedæmonian
interference against Polykratês as an example of standing Spartan
hatred against despots. Indeed, the only facts which we know, to
sustain this anti-despotic sentiment for which the Lacedæmonians had
credit, are, their proceedings against Polykratês and Hippias; there
may have been other analogous cases, but we cannot specify them with
certainty. However this may be, a joint Lacedæmonian and Corinthian
force accompanied the exiles back to Samos, and assailed Polykratês
in the city. They did their best to capture it, for forty days, and
were at one time on the point of succeeding, but were finally obliged
to retire without any success. “The city would have been taken,”
says Herodotus, “if all the Lacedæmonians had acted like Archias
and Lykôpas,”—who, pressing closely upon the retreating Samians,
were shut within the town-gates, and perished. The historian had
heard this exploit in personal conversation with Archias, grandson
of the person above mentioned, in the deme Pitana at Sparta,—whose
father had been named Samius, and who respected the Samians above
any other Greeks, because they had bestowed upon the two brave
warriors, slain within their town, an honorable and public funeral.<a
id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> It
is rarely that Herodotus thus specifies his informants: had he done
so more frequently the value as well as the interest of his history
would have been materially increased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[p. 244]</span>On the
retirement of the Lacedæmonian force, the Samian exiles were left
destitute; and looking out for some community to plunder, weak as
well as rich, they pitched upon the island of Siphnos. The Siphnians
of that day were the wealthiest islanders in the Ægean, from the
productiveness of their gold and silver mines,—the produce of which
was annually distributed among the citizens, reserving a tithe
for the Delphian temple.<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441"
class="fnanchor">[441]</a> Their treasure-chamber was among the
most richly furnished of which that holy place could boast, and
they themselves, probably, in these times of early prosperity, were
numbered among the most brilliant of the Ionic visitors at the Delian
festival. The Samians landing at Siphnos, demanded a contribution,
under the name of a loan, of ten talents: which being refused, they
proceeded to ravage the island, inflicting upon the inhabitants
a severe defeat, and ultimately extorting from them one hundred
talents. They next purchased from the inhabitants of Hermionê, in
the Argolic peninsula, the neighboring island of Hydrea, famous in
modern Greek warfare. But it appears that their plans must have been
subsequently changed, for, instead of occupying it, they placed it
under the care of the Trœzenians, and repaired themselves to Krete,
for the purpose of expelling the Zakynthian settlers at Kydônia. In
this they succeeded, and were induced to establish themselves in that
place. But after they had remained there five years, the Kretans
obtained naval aid from Ægina, whereby the place was recovered, and
the Samian intruders finally sold into slavery.<a id="FNanchor_442"
href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a></p>

<p>Such was the melancholy end of the enemies of Polykratês:
meanwhile, that despot himself was more powerful and prosperous
than ever. Samos, under him, was “the first of all cities,
Hellenic or barbaric:<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443"
class="fnanchor">[443]</a>” and the great works admired by
Herodotus in the island,<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444"
class="fnanchor">[444]</a>—an aqueduct for the city, tunnelled
through a mountain for the length of seven furlongs,—a mole to
protect the harbor, two furlongs long and twenty fathoms deep,
and the vast temple of Hêrê, may probably have been enlarged and
com<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[p. 245]</span>pleted, if not
begun, by him. Aristotle quotes the public works of Polykratês as
instances of the profound policy of despots, to occupy as well as to
impoverish their subjects.<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445"
class="fnanchor">[445]</a> The earliest of all Grecian thalassokrats,
or sea-kings,—master of the greatest naval force in the Ægean,
as well as of many among its islands,—he displayed his love of
letters by friendship to Anakreon, and his piety by consecrating
to the Delian Apollo<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446"
class="fnanchor">[446]</a> the neighboring island of Rhêneia. But
while thus outshining all his contemporaries, victorious over
Sparta and Corinth, and projecting farther aggrandizement, he was
precipitated on a sudden into the abyss of ruin;<a id="FNanchor_447"
href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> and that too, as if
to demonstrate unequivocally the agency of the envious gods, not from
the revenge of any of his numerous victims, but from the gratuitous
malice of a stranger whom he had never wronged and never even seen.
The Persian satrap Orœtês, on the neighboring mainland, conceived
an implacable hatred against him: no one could tell why,—for he
had no design of attacking the island; and the trifling reasons
conjecturally assigned, only prove that the real reason, whatever it
might be, was unknown. Availing himself of the notorious ambition
and cupidity of Polykratês, Orœtês sent to Samos a messenger,
pretending that his life was menaced by Kambysês, and that he was
anxious to make his escape with his abundant treasures. He proposed
to Polykratês a share in this treasure, sufficient to make him master
of all Greece, as far as that object could be achieved by money,
provided the Samian prince would come over to convey him away.
Mæandrius, secretary of Polykratês, was sent over to Magnêsia on
the Mæander, to make inquiries; he there saw the satrap with eight
large coffers full of gold,—or rather apparently so, being in reality
full of stones, with a layer of gold at the top,<a id="FNanchor_448"
href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a>—tied up ready
for departure. The cupidity of Polykratês was not proof against
so rich a bait: he crossed over to Magnêsia with a considerable
suite, and thus came into the power of Orœtês, in spite of the
warnings of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[p. 246]</span>
prophets and the agony of his terrified daughter, to whom his
approaching fate had been revealed in a dream. The satrap slew him
and crucified his body; releasing all the Samians who accompanied
him, with an intimation that they ought to thank him for procuring
them a free government,—but retaining both the foreigners and the
slaves as prisoners.<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449"
class="fnanchor">[449]</a> The death of Orœtês himself, which
ensued shortly afterwards, has already been described. It is
considered by Herodotus as a judgment for his flagitious deed in
the case of Polykratês.<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450"
class="fnanchor">[450]</a></p>

<p>At the departure of the latter from Samos, in anticipation of a
speedy return, Mæandrius had been left as his lieutenant at Samos;
and the unexpected catastrophe of Polykratês filled him with surprise
and consternation. Though possessed of the fortresses, the soldiers,
and the treasures, which had constituted the machinery of his
powerful master, he knew the risk of trying to employ them on his
own account. Partly from this apprehension, partly from the genuine
political morality which prevailed with more or less force in every
Grecian bosom, he resolved to lay down his authority and enfranchise
the island. “He wished (says the historian, in a remarkable phrase)<a
id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> to
act like the justest of men; but he was not allowed to do so.” His
first proceeding was to erect in the suburbs an altar in honor of
Zeus Eleutherius, and to inclose a piece of ground as a precinct,
which still existed in the time of Herodotus: he next convened an
assembly of the Samians. “You know (says he) that the whole power
of Polykratês is now in my hands, nor is there anything to hinder
me from continuing to rule over you. Nevertheless, what I condemn
in another I will not do myself,—and I have always disapproved of
Polykratês, and others like him, for seeking to rule over men as
good as themselves. Now that Polykratês has come to the end of his
destiny, I at once lay down the command, and proclaim among you equal
law; reserving to myself as privileges, first, six talents out of the
treasures of Polykratês,—next, the hereditary<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_247">[p. 247]</span> priesthood of Zeus Eleutherius for
myself and my descendants forever. To him I have just set apart a
sacred precinct, as the God of that freedom which I now hand over to
you.”</p>

<p>This reasonable and generous proposition fully justifies the
epithet of Herodotus. But very differently was it received by the
Samian hearers. One of the chief men among them, Telesarchus,
exclaimed, with the applause of the rest, “<i>You</i> rule us, low-born
and scoundrel as you are! you are not worthy to rule: don’t
think of that, but give us some account of the money which you
have been handling.”<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452"
class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>

<p>Such an unexpected reply caused a total revolution in the mind
of Mæandrius. It left him no choice but to maintain dominion at
all hazards,—which he accordingly resolved to do. Retiring into
the acropolis, under pretence of preparing his money-accounts for
examination, he sent for Telesarchus and his chief political enemies,
one by one,—intimating that they were open to inspection. As fast
as they arrived they were put in chains, while Mæandrius remained
in the acropolis, with his soldiers and his treasures, as the
avowed successor of Polykratês. And thus the Samians, after a short
hour of insane boastfulness, found themselves again enslaved. “It
seemed (says Herodotus) that they were not willing to be free.”<a
id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></p>

<p>We cannot but contrast their conduct on this occasion with that
of the Athenians about twelve years afterwards, on the expulsion
of Hippias, which has been recounted in a previous chapter. The
position of the Samians was far the more favorable of the two, for
the quiet and successful working of a free government; for they had
the advantage of a voluntary as well as a sincere resignation from
the actual despot. Yet the thirst for reactionary investigation
prevented them even from taking a reasonable estimate of their own
power of enforcing it: they passed at once from extreme subjection
to overbearing and ruinous rashness. Whereas the Athenians, under
circumstances far less promising, avoided the fatal mistake of
sacrificing the pros<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[p.
248]</span>pects of the future to recollections of the past;
showed themselves both anxious to acquire the rights, and willing
to perform the obligations, of a free community; listened to wise
counsels, maintained unanimous action, and overcame, by heroic
efforts, forces very greatly superior. If we compare the reflections
of Herodotus on the one case and on the other,<a id="FNanchor_454"
href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> we shall be
struck with the difference which those reflections imply between
the Athenians and the Samians,—a difference partly referable,
doubtless, to the pure Hellenism of the former, contrasted with the
half-Asiatized Hellenism of the latter,—but also traceable in a great
degree to the preliminary lessons of the Solonian constitution,
overlaid, but not extinguished, during the despotism of the
Peisistratids which followed.</p>

<p>The events which succeeded in Samos are little better than a
series of crimes and calamities. The prisoners, whom Mæandrius had
detained in the acropolis, were slain during his dangerous illness,
by his brother Lykarêtus, under the idea that this would enable him
more easily to seize the sceptre. But Mæandrius recovered, and must
have continued as despot for a year or two: it was, however, a weak
despotism, contested more or less in the island, and very different
from the iron hand of Polykratês. In this untoward condition, the
Samians were surprised by the arrival of a new claimant for their
sceptre and acropolis,—and, what was much more formidable, a Persian
army to back him.</p>

<p>Sylosôn, the brother of Polykratês, having taken part originally
in his brother’s conspiracy and usurpation, had been at first allowed
to share the fruits of it, but quickly found himself banished. In
this exile he remained during the whole life of Polykratês, and until
the accession of Darius to the Persian throne, which followed about
a year after the death of Polykratês. He happened to be at Memphis,
in Egypt, during the time when Kambysês was there with his conquering
army, and when Darius, then a Persian of little note, was serving
among his guards. Sylosôn was walking in the agora of Memphis,
wearing a scarlet cloak, to which Darius took a great fancy, and
proposed to buy it. A divine inspiration prompted Sylosôn to reply,<a
id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a>
“I cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[p. 249]</span> for
any price sell it; but I give it you for nothing, if it must be
yours.” Darius thanked him, and accepted the cloak; and for some
years the donor accused himself of a silly piece of good-nature.<a
id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> But
as events came round, Sylosôn at length heard with surprise that the
unknown Persian, whom he had presented with the cloak at Memphis, was
installed as king in the palace at Susa. He went thither, proclaimed
himself as a Greek, as well as benefactor of the new king, and was
admitted to the regal presence. Darius had forgotten his person,
but perfectly remembered the adventure of the cloak, when it was
brought to his mind,—and showed himself forward to requite, on the
scale becoming the Great King, former favors, though small, rendered
to the simple soldier at Memphis. Gold and silver were tendered to
Sylosôn in profusion, but he rejected them,—requesting that the
island of Samos might be conquered and handed over to him, without
slaughter or enslavement of inhabitants. His request was complied
with. Otanês, the originator of the conspiracy against Smerdis, was
sent down to the coast of Ionia with an army, carried Sylosôn over to
Samos, and landed him unexpectedly on the island.<a id="FNanchor_457"
href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a></p>

<p>Mæandrius was in no condition to resist the invasion, nor were
the Samians generally disposed to sustain him. He accordingly
concluded a convention with Otanês, whereby he agreed to make way
for Sylosôn, to evacuate the island, and to admit the Persians at
once into the city; retaining possession, however—for such time
as might be necessary to embark his property and treasures—of
the acropolis, which had a separate landing-place, and even a
subterranean passage and secret portal for embarkation,—probably
one of the precautionary provisions of Polykratês. Otanês willingly
granted these conditions, and himself with his principal officers
entered the town, the army being quartered around; while Sylosôn
seemed on the point of ascending the seat of his deceased brother
without violence or bloodshed. But the Samians were destined to
a fate more calamitous. Mæandrius had a brother named Charilaus,
violent in his temper, and half a madman, whom he was obliged to keep
in confine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[p. 250]</span>ment.
This man looking out of his chamber-window, saw the Persian officers
seated peaceably throughout the town and even under the gates of
the acropolis, unguarded, and relying upon the convention: it
seems that these were the chief officers, whose rank gave them the
privilege of being carried about on their seats.<a id="FNanchor_458"
href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> The sight inflamed
both his wrath and his insane ambition; he clamored for liberty and
admission to his brother, whom he reviled as a coward no less than a
tyrant. “Here are you, worthless man, keeping me, your own brother,
in a dungeon, though I have done no wrong worthy of bonds; while you
do not dare to take your revenge on the Persians, who are casting
you out as a houseless exile, and whom it would be so easy to put
down. If you are afraid of them, give me your guards; I will make the
Persians repent of their coming here, and I will send you safely out
of the island forthwith.”<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459"
class="fnanchor">[459]</a></p>

<p>Mæandrius, on the point of quitting Samos forever, had little
personal motive to care what became of the population. He had
probably never forgiven them for disappointing his honorable
intentions after the death of Polykratês, nor was he displeased to
hand over to Sylosôn an odious and blood-stained sceptre, which he
foresaw would be the only consequence of his brother’s mad project.
He therefore sailed away with his treasures, leaving the acropolis
to his brother Charilaus; who immediately armed the guards, sallied
forth from his fortress, and attacked the unsuspecting Persians. Many
of the great officers were slain without resistance before the army
could be got together; but at length Otanês collected his troops and
drove the assailants back into the acropolis. While he immediately
began the siege of that fortress, he also resolved, as Mæandrius had
foreseen, to take a signal revenge for the treacherous slaughter of
so many of his friends and companions. His army, no less incensed
than him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[p. 251]</span>self,
were directed to fall upon the Samian people and massacre them
without discrimination,—man and boy, on ground sacred as well as
profane. The bloody order was too faithfully executed, and Samos
was handed over to Sylosôn, stripped of its male inhabitants.<a
id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a>
Of Charilaus and the acropolis we hear no farther, perhaps he and
his guards may have escaped by sea. Lykarêtus,<a id="FNanchor_461"
href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> the other brother of
Mæandrius, must have remained either in the service of Sylosôn or in
that of the Persians; for we find him some years afterwards intrusted
by the latter with an important command.</p>

<p>Sylosôn was thus finally installed as despot of an island peopled
chiefly, if not wholly, with women and children: we may, however,
presume, that the deed of blood has been described by the historian
as more sweeping than it really was. It seems, nevertheless, to have
sat heavily on the conscience of Otanês, who was induced sometime
afterwards, by a dream and by a painful disease, to take measures
for repeopling the island.<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462"
class="fnanchor">[462]</a> From whence the new population came, we
are not told: but wholesale translations of inhabitants from one
place to another were familiar to the mind of a Persian king or
satrap.</p>

<p>Mæandrius, following the example of the previous Samian exiles
under Polykratês, went to Sparta and sought aid for the purpose
of reëstablishing himself at Samos. But the Lacedæmonians had no
disposition to repeat an attempt which had before turned out so
unsuccessfully, nor could he seduce king Kleomenês by the display of
his treasures and finely-wrought gold plate. The king, however, not
without fear that such seductions might win over some of the Spartan
leading men, prevailed with the ephors to send Mæandrius away.<a
id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></p>

<p>Sylosôn seems to have remained undisturbed at Samos, as a
tributary of Persia, like the Ionic cities on the continent: some
years afterwards we find his son Æakês reigning in the island.<a
id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a>
Strabo states that it was the harsh rule of Sylosôn which caused
the depopulation of the island. But the cause just recounted out
of Herodotus is both very different and sufficiently plausible
in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[p. 252]</span> itself;
and as Strabo seems in the main to have derived his account from
Herodotus, we may suppose that on this point he has incorrectly
remembered his authority.<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465"
class="fnanchor">[465]</a></p>

  <h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXIV.<br />
    DEMOKEDES. — DARIUS INVADES SCYTHIA.</h2>
</div>

<p class="mt1"><span class="smcap">Darius</span> had now acquired
full authority throughout the Persian empire, having put down
the refractory satrap Orœtês, as well as the revolted Medes and
Babylonians. He had, moreover, completed the conquest of Ionia, by
the important addition of Samos; and his dominion thus comprised all
Asia Minor, with its neighboring islands. But this was not sufficient
for the ambition of a Persian king, next but one in succession to
the great Cyrus. The conquering impulse was yet unabated among the
Persians, who thought it incumbent upon their king, and whose king
thought it incumbent upon himself, to extend the limits of the
empire. Though not of the lineage of Cyrus, Darius had taken pains
to connect himself with it by marriage; he had married Atossa and
Artystonê, daughters of Cyrus,—and Parmys, daughter of Smerdis, the
younger son of Cyrus. Atossa had been first the wife of her brother
Kambysês; next, of the Magian Smerdis, his successor; and thirdly
of Darius, to whom she bore four children.<a id="FNanchor_466"
href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> Of those children the
eldest was Xerxês, respecting whom more will be said hereafter.</p>

<p>Atossa, mother of the only Persian king who ever set foot in
Greece, the Sultana Validi of Persia during the reign of Xerxês,
was a person of commanding influence in the reign of her<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[p. 253]</span> last husband,<a
id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> as
well as in that of her son, and filled no inconsiderable space even
in Grecian imagination, as we may see both by Æschylus and Herodotus.
Had her influence prevailed, the first conquering appetites of Darius
would have been directed, not against the steppes of Scythia, but
against Attica and Peloponnesus; at least, so Herodotus assures us.
The grand object of the latter in his history is to set forth the
contentions of Hellas with the barbarians or non-Hellenic world;
and with an art truly epical, which manifests itself everywhere
to the careful reader of his nine books, he preludes to the real
dangers which were averted at Marathon and Platæa, by recounting the
first conception of an invasion of Greece by the Persians,—how it
originated, and how it was abandoned. For this purpose,—according
to his historical style, wherein general facts are set forth as
subordinate and explanatory accompaniments to the adventures of
particular persons,—he give us the interesting, but romantic, history
of the Krotoniate surgeon Dêmokêdês.</p>

<p>Dêmokêdês, son of a citizen of Krotôn named Kalliphôn, had turned
his attention in early youth to the study and practice of medicine
and surgery (for that age, we can make no difference between the
two), and had made considerable progress in it. His youth coincides
nearly with the arrival of Pythagoras at Krotôn, (550-520,) where
the science of the surgeon, as well as the art of the gymnastic
trainer, seem to have been then prosecuted more actively than in
any part of Greece. His father Kalliphôn, however, was a man of
such severe temper, that the son ran away from him, and resolved to
maintain himself by his talents elsewhere. He went to Ægina, and
began to practice in his profession; and so rapid was his success,
even in his first year,—though very imperfectly equipped with
instruments and apparatus,<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468"
class="fnanchor">[468]</a>—that the citizens of the island made a
contract with him to remain there for one year, at a salary of one
talent (about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[p. 254]</span>
three hundred and eighty-three pounds sterling, an Æginæan talent).
The year afterwards he was invited to come to Athens, then under the
Peisistratids, at a salary of one hundred minæ, or one and two-thirds
of a talent; and in the following year, Polykratês of Samos tempted
him by the offer of two talents. With that<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_255">[p. 255]</span> despot he remained, and accompanied him
in his last calamitous visit to the satrap Orœtês: on the murder of
Polykratês, being seized among the slaves and foreign attendants, he
was left to languish with the rest in imprisonment and neglect. When
again, soon after, Orœtês himself was slain, Dêmokêdês was numbered
among his slaves and chattels and sent up to Susa.</p>

<p>He had not been long at that capital, when Darius, leaping from
his horse in the chase, sprained his foot badly, and was carried home
in violent pain. The Egyptian surgeons, supposed to be the first
men in their profession,<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469"
class="fnanchor">[469]</a> whom he habitually employed, did him no
good, but only aggravated his torture; for seven days and nights he
had no sleep, and he as well as those around him began to despair.
At length, some one who had been at Sardis, accidentally recollected
that he had heard of a Greek surgeon among the slaves of Orœtês:
search was immediately made, and the miserable slave was brought, in
chains as well as in rags,<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470"
class="fnanchor">[470]</a> into the presence of the royal sufferer.
Being asked whether he understood surgery, he affected ignorance;
but Darius, suspecting this to be a mere artifice, ordered out the
scourge and the pricking instrument, to overcome it. Dêmokêdês now
saw that there was no resource, admitted that he had acquired some
little skill, and was called upon to do his utmost in the case before
him. He was fortunate enough to succeed perfectly, in alleviating the
pain, in procuring sleep for the exhausted patient, and ultimately
in restoring the foot to a sound state. Darius, who had abandoned
all hopes of such a cure, knew no bounds to his gratitude. As a
first reward, he presented him with two sets of chains in solid
gold,—a commemoration of the state in which Dêmokêdês had first come
before him,—he next sent him into the harem to visit his wives.
The conducting eunuchs introduced him as the man who had restored
the king to life, and the grateful sultanas each gave to him a
saucer full of golden coins called staters;<a id="FNanchor_471"
href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> in all so numerous,
that the slave Skitôn,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[p.
256]</span> who followed him, was enriched by merely picking up the
pieces which dropped on the floor. Nor was this all. Darius gave
him a splendid house and furniture, made him the companion of his
table, and showed him every description of favor. He was about to
crucify the Egyptian surgeons who had been so unsuccessful in their
attempts to cure him; but Dêmokêdês had the happiness of preserving
their lives, as well as of rescuing an unfortunate companion of his
imprisonment,—an Eleian prophet, who had followed the fortunes of
Polykratês.</p>

<p>But there was one favor which Darius would on no account grant;
yet upon this one Dêmokêdês had set his heart,—the liberty of
returning to Greece. At length accident, combined with his own
surgical skill, enabled him to escape from the splendor of his
second detention, as it had before extricated him from the misery of
the first. A tumor formed upon the breast of Atossa; at first, she
said nothing to any one, but as it became too bad for concealment,
she was forced to consult Dêmokêdês. He promised to cure her, but
required from her a solemn oath that she would afterwards do for
him anything which he should ask,—pledging himself at the same time
to ask nothing indecent.<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472"
class="fnanchor">[472]</a> The cure was successful, and Atossa was
required to repay it by procuring his liberty. He knew that the favor
would be refused, even to her, if directly solicited, but he taught
her a stratagem for obtaining under false pretences the consent
of Darius. She took an early opportunity, Herodotus tells us,<a
id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> in
bed, of reminding Darius that the Persians expected from him some
positive addition to the power and splendor of the empire; and when
Darius, in answer, acquainted her that he contemplated a speedy
expedition against the Scythians, she entreated him to postpone
it, and to turn his forces first against Greece: “I have<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[p. 257]</span> heard (she said)
about the maidens of Sparta, Athens, Argos, and Corinth, and I want
to have some of them as slaves to serve me—(we may conceive the
smile of triumph with which the sons of those who had conquered
at Platæa and Salamis would hear this part of the history read by
Herodotus);—you have near you the best person possible to give
information about Greece,—that Greek who cured your foot.” Darius
was induced by this request to send some confidential Persians into
Greece to procure information, along with Dêmokêdês. Selecting
fifteen of them, he ordered them to survey the coasts and cities
of Greece, under guidance of Dêmokêdês, but with peremptory orders
upon no account to let him escape or to return without him. He next
sent for Dêmokêdês himself, explained to him what he wanted, and
enjoined him imperatively to return as soon as the business had been
completed; he farther desired him to carry away with him all the
ample donations which he had already received, as presents to his
father and brothers, promising that on his return fresh donations
of equal value should make up the loss: lastly, he directed that a
storeship, “filled with all manner of good things,” should accompany
the voyage. Dêmokêdês undertook the mission with every appearance of
sincerity. The better to play his part, he declined to take away what
he already possessed at Susa,—saying, that he should like to find his
property and furniture again on coming back, and that the storeship
alone, with its contents, would be sufficient both for the voyage and
for all necessary presents.</p>

<p>Accordingly, he and the fifteen Persian envoys went down to
Sidon in Phenicia, where two armed triremes were equipped, with a
large storeship in company; and the voyage of survey into Greece
was commenced. They visited and examined all the principal places
in Greece,—probably beginning with the Asiatic and insular Greeks,
crossing to Eubœa, circumnavigating Attica and Peloponnesus,
then passing to Korkyra and Italy. They surveyed the coasts and
cities, taking memoranda<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474"
class="fnanchor">[474]</a> of everything worthy of note which they
saw: this Periplûs, if it had been preserved, would have been
inestimable, as an account<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[p.
258]</span> of the actual state of the Grecian world about
518 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> As soon as they arrived at Tarentum,
Dêmokêdês—now within a short distance of his own home, Krotôn—found
an opportunity of executing what he had meditated from the beginning.
At his request Aristophilidês, the king of Tarentum, seized the
fifteen Persians, and detained them as spies, at the same time taking
the rudders from off their ships,—while Dêmokêdês himself made his
escape to Krotôn. As soon as he had arrived there, Aristophilidês
released the Persians, and suffered them to pursue their voyage: they
went on to Krotôn, found Dêmokêdês in the market-place, and laid
hands upon him. But his fellow-citizens released him, not without
opposition from some who were afraid of provoking the Great King,
and in spite of remonstrances, energetic and menacing, from the
Persians themselves: indeed, the Krotôniates not only protected the
restored exile, but even robbed the Persians of their storeship.
The latter, disabled from proceeding farther, as well by this loss
as by the secession of Dêmokêdês, commenced their voyage homeward,
but unfortunately suffered shipwreck near the Iapygian cape, and
became slaves in that neighborhood. A Tarentine exile, named Gillus,
ransomed them and carried them up to Susa,—a service for which
Darius promised him any recompense that he chose. Restoration to his
native city was all that Gillus asked; and that too, not by force,
but by the mediation of the Asiatic Greeks of Knidus, who were
on terms of intimate alliance with the Tarentines. This generous
citizen,—an honorable contrast to Dêmokêdês, who had not scrupled
to impel the stream of Persian conquest against his country, in
order to procure his own release,—was unfortunately disappointed
of his anticipated recompense. For though the Knidians, at the
injunction of Darius, employed all their influence at Tarentum to
procure a revocation of the sentence of exile, they were unable to
succeed, and force was out of the question.<a id="FNanchor_475"
href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> The last words
addressed by Dêmokêdês at parting to his Persian companions, exhorted
them to acquaint Darius that he (Dêmokêdês) was about to marry the
daughter of the Krotoniate Milo,—one of the first men in Krotôn,
as well as the greatest wrestler of his time. The reputation of
Milo was very great with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[p.
259]</span> Darius,—probably from the talk of Dêmokêdês himself:
moreover, gigantic muscular force could be appreciated by men who
had no relish either for Homer or Solon. And thus did this clever
and vainglorious Greek, sending back his fifteen Persian companions
to disgrace, and perhaps to death, deposit in their parting ears a
braggart message, calculated to create for himself a factitious name
at Susa. He paid a large sum to Milo as the price of his daughter,
for this very purpose.<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476"
class="fnanchor">[476]</a></p>

<p>Thus finishes the history of Dêmokêdês, and of the “first
Persians (to use the phrase of Herodotus) who ever came over
from Asia into Greece.”<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477"
class="fnanchor">[477]</a> It is a history well deserving of
attention, even looking only to the liveliness of the incidents,
introducing us as they do into the full movement of the ancient
world,—incidents which I see no reason for doubting, with a
reasonable allowance for the dramatic amplification of the historian.
Even at that early date, Greek medical intelligence stands out
in a surpassing manner, and Dêmokêdês is the first of those
many able Greek surgeons who were seized, carried up to Susa,<a
id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> and
there detained for the Great King, his court, and harem.</p>

<p>But his history suggests, in another point of view, far more
serious reflections. Like the Milesian Histiæus (of whom I shall
speak hereafter,) he cared not what amount of risk he brought upon
his country in order to procure his own escape from a splendid
detention at Susa. And the influence which he originated and brought
to bear was on the point of precipitating upon Greece the whole force
of the Persian empire, at a time when Greece was in no condition
to resist it. Had the first aggressive<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_260">[p. 260]</span> expedition of Darius, with his own
personal command and fresh appetite for conquest, been directed
against Greece instead of against Scythia (between 516-514 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), Grecian independence would have perished almost
infallibly. For Athens was then still governed by the Peisistratids;
what she was, under them, we have had occasion to notice in a
former chapter. She had then no courage for energetic self-defence,
and probably Hippias himself, far from offering resistance, would
have found it advantageous to accept Persian dominion as a means
of strengthening his own rule, like the Ionian despots: moreover,
Grecian habit of coöperation was then only just commencing. But
fortunately, the Persian invader did not touch the shore of Greece
until more than twenty years afterwards, in 490 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>;
and during that precious interval, the Athenian character had
undergone the memorable revolution which has been before described.
Their energy and their organization had been alike improved, and
their force of resistance had become decupled; moreover, their
conduct had so provoked the Persian that resistance was then a
matter of necessity with them, and submission on tolerable terms an
impossibility. When we come to the grand Persian invasion of Greece,
we shall see that Athens was the life and soul of all the opposition
offered. We shall see farther, that with all the efforts of Athens,
the success of the defence was more than once doubtful; and would
have been converted into a very different result, if Xerxês had
listened to the best of his own counsellors. But had Darius, at the
head of the very same force which he conducted into Scythia, or even
an inferior force, landed at Marathon in 514 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,
instead of sending Datis in 490 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,—he would have
found no men like the victors of Marathon to meet him. As far as
we can appreciate the probabilities, he would have met with little
resistance except from the Spartans singly, who would have maintained
their own very defensible territory against all his efforts,—like the
Mysians and Pisidians in Asia Minor, or like the Mainots of Laconia
in later days; but Hellas generally would have become a Persian
satrapy. Fortunately, Darius, while bent on invading some country,
had set his mind on the attack of Scythia, alike perilous and
unprofitable. His personal ardor was wasted on those unconquerable
regions, where he narrowly escaped the disastrous fate of
Cyrus,—nor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[p. 261]</span> did he
ever pay a second visit to the coasts of the Ægean. Yet the amorous
influences of Atossa, set at work by Dêmokêdês might well have been
sufficiently powerful to induce Darius to assail Greece instead
of Scythia,—a choice in favor of which all other recommendations
concurred; and the history of free Greece would then probably have
stopped at this point, without unrolling any of the glories which
followed. So incalculably great has been the influence of Grecian
development, during the two centuries between 500-300 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, on the destinies of mankind, that we cannot pass without
notice a contingency which threatened to arrest that development
in the bud. Indeed, it may be remarked that the history of any
nation, considered as a sequence of causes and effects, affording
applicable knowledge, requires us to study not merely real events,
but also imminent contingencies,—events which were on the point of
occurring, but yet did not occur. When we read the wailings of Atossa
in the Persæ of Æschylus, for the humiliation which her son Xerxês
had just undergone in his flight from Greece,<a id="FNanchor_479"
href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> we do not easily
persuade ourselves to reverse the picture, and to conceive the same
Atossa twenty years earlier, numbering as her slaves at Susa the
noblest Hêrakleid and Alkmæônid maidens from Greece. Yet the picture
would really have been thus reversed,—the wish of Atossa would have
been fulfilled, and the wailings would have been heard from enslaved
Greek maidens in Persia,—if the mind of Darius had not happened to
be preoccupied with a project not less insane even than those of
Kambysês against Ethiopia and the Libyan desert. Such at least is the
moral of the story of Dêmokêdês.</p>

<p>That insane expedition across the Danube into Scythia comes now
to be recounted. It was undertaken by Darius for the purpose of
avenging the inroad and devastation of the Scythians in Media and
Upper Asia, about a century before. The lust of conquest imparted
unusual force to this sentiment of wounded dignity, which in the
case of the Scythians could hardly be connected with any expectation
of plunder or profit. In spite of the dissuading admonition of
his brother Artabanus,<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480"
class="fnanchor">[480]</a> Darius<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_262">[p. 262]</span> summoned the whole force of his
empire, army and navy, to the Thracian Bosphorus,—a force not less
than seven hundred thousand horse and foot, and six hundred ships,
according to Herodotus. On these prodigious numbers we can lay no
stress. But it appears that the names of all the various nations
composing the host were inscribed on two pillars, erected by order
of Darius on the European side of the Bosphorus, and afterwards seen
by Herodotus himself in the city of Byzantium,—the inscriptions
were bilingual, in Assyrian characters as well as Greek. The Samian
architect Mandroklês had been directed to throw a bridge of boats
across the Bosphorus, about half-way between Byzantium and the mouth
of the Euxine. So peremptory were the Persian kings that their orders
for military service should be punctually obeyed, and so impatient
were they of the idea of exemptions, that when a Persian father
named Œobazus entreated that one of his three sons, all included in
the conscription, might be left at home, Darius replied that all
three of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[p. 263]</span>
should be left at home,—an answer which the unsuspecting father
heard with delight. They were indeed all left at home,—for they
were all put to death.<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481"
class="fnanchor">[481]</a> A proceeding similar to this is ascribed
afterwards to Xerxês;<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482"
class="fnanchor">[482]</a> whether true or not as matters of fact,
both tales illustrate the wrathful displeasure with which the Persian
kings were known to receive such petitions for exemption.</p>

<p>The naval force of Darius seems to have consisted entirely of
subject Greeks, Asiatic and insular; for the Phenician fleet was
not brought into the Ægean until the subsequent Ionic revolt.
At this time all or most of the Asiatic Greek cities were under
despots, who leaned on the Persian government for support, and
who appeared with their respective contingents to take part in
the Scythian expedition.<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483"
class="fnanchor">[483]</a> Of Ionic Greeks were seen,—Strattis,
despot of Chios; Æakês son of Sylosôn, despot of Samos; Laodamas, of
Phôkæa; and Histiæus, of Milêtus. From the Æolic towns, Aristagoras
of Kymê; from the Hellespontine Greeks, Daphnis of Abydus, Hippoklus
of Lampsakus, Hêrophantus of Parium, Metrodôrus of Prokonnêsus,
Aristagoras of Kyzikus, and Miltiadês of the Thracian Chersonese.
All these are mentioned, and there were probably more. This large
fleet, assembled at the Bosphorus, was sent forward into the
Euxine to the mouth of the Danube,—with orders to sail up the
river two days’ journey, above the point where its channel begins
to divide, and to throw a bridge of boats over it; while Darius,
having liberally recompensed the architect Mandroklês, crossed the
bridge over the Bosphorus, and began his march through Thrace,
receiving the submission of various Thracian tribes in his way, and
subduing others,—especially the Getæ north of Mount Hæmus, who were
compelled to increase still farther the numbers of his vast army.<a
id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> On
arriving at the Danube, he found the bridge finished and prepared for
his passage by the Ionians: we may remark here, as on so many other
occasions, that all operations requiring intelligence are performed
for the Persians either by Greeks or by Phenicians,—more usually by
the for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[p. 264]</span>mer. He
crossed this greatest of all earthly rivers,<a id="FNanchor_485"
href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a>—for so the Danube
was imagined to be in the fifth century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,—and
directed his march into Scythia.</p>

<p>As far as the point now attained, our narrative runs smoothly and
intelligibly: we know that Darius marched his army into Scythia,
and that he came back with ignominy and severe loss. But as to all
which happened between his crossing and recrossing the Danube,
we find nothing approaching to authentic statement,—nothing even
which we can set forth as the probable basis of truth on which
exaggerating fancy has been at work. All is inexplicable mystery.
Ktêsias indeed says that Darius marched for fifteen days into the
Scythian territory,—that he then exchanged bows with the king of
Scythia, and discovered the Scythian bow to be the largest,—and
that, being intimidated by such discovery, he fled back to the
bridge by which he had crossed the Danube, and recrossed the river
with the loss of one-tenth part of his army,<a id="FNanchor_486"
href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> being compelled to
break down the bridge before all had passed. The length of march is
here the only thing distinctly stated; about the direction nothing
is said. But the narrative of Ktêsias, defective as it is, is much
less perplexing than that of Herodotus, who conducts the immense host
of Darius as it were through fairy-land,—heedless of distance, large
intervening rivers, want of all cultivation or supplies, destruction
of the country—in so far as it could be destroyed—by the retreating
Scythians, etc. He tells us that the Persian army consisted chiefly
of foot,—that there were no roads nor agriculture; yet his narrative
carries it over about twelve degrees of longitude from the Danube
to the country east of the Tanais, across the rivers Tyras<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[p. 265]</span> (Dniester), Hypanis
(Bog), Borysthenês (Dnieper), Hypakyris. Gerrhos, and Tanais.<a
id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a>
How these rivers could have been passed in the face of enemies by so
vast a host, we are left to conjecture, since it was not winter time,
to convert them into ice: nor does the historian even allude to them
as having been crossed either in the advance or in the retreat. What
is not less remarkable is, that in respect to the Greek settlement
of Olbia, or Borysthenês, and the agricultural Scythians and
Mix-hellenes between the Hypanis and the Borysthenês, across whose
country it would seem that this march of Darius must have carried
him,—Herodotus does not say anything; though we should have expected
that he would have had better means of informing himself about this
part of the march than about any other, and though the Persians could
hardly have failed to plunder or put in requisition this, the only
productive portion of Scythia.</p>

<p>The narrative of Herodotus in regard to the Persian march north of
the Ister seems indeed destitute of all the conditions of reality.
It is rather an imaginative description, illustrating the desperate
and impracticable character of Scythian warfare, and grouping in
the same picture, according to that large sweep of the imagination
which is admissible in epical treatment, the Scythians, with all
their barbarous neighbors from the Carpathian mountains to the river
Wolga. The Agathyrsi, the Neuri, the Androphagi, the Melanchlæni,
the Budini, the Gelôni, the Sarmatians, and the Tauri,—all of
them bordering on that vast quadrangular area of four thousand
stadia for each side, called Scythia, as Herodotus conceives it,<a
id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a>—are
brought into deliberation and action in consequence of the Persian
approach. And Herodotus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[p.
266]</span> takes that opportunity of communicating valuable
particulars respecting the habits and manners of each. The kings of
these nations discuss whether Darius is justified in his invasion,
and whether it be prudent in them to aid the Scythians. The latter
question is decided in the affirmative by the Sarmatians, the Budini,
and the Gelôni, all eastward of the Tanais,<a id="FNanchor_489"
href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a>—in the negative by
the rest. The Scythians, removing their wagons with their wives and
children out of the way northward, retreat and draw Darius after them
from the Danube all across Scythia and Sarmatia to the north-eastern
extremity of the territory of the Budini,<a id="FNanchor_490"
href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> several days’ journey
eastward of the Tanais. Moreover, they destroy the wells and ruin
the herbage as much as they can, so that during all this long march,
says Herodotus, the Persians “found nothing to damage, inasmuch as
the country was barren;” it is therefore not easy to see what they
could find to live upon. It is in the territory of the Budini, at
this easternmost terminus on the borders of the desert, that the
Persians perform the only positive acts which are ascribed to them
throughout the whole expedition. They burn the wooden wall before
occupied, but now deserted, by the Gelôni, and they build, or begin
to build, eight large fortresses near the river Oarus. For what
purpose these fortresses could have been intended, Herodotus gives
no intimation; but he says that the unfinished work was yet to be
seen even in his day.<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491"
class="fnanchor">[491]</a></p>

<p>Having thus been carried all across Scythia and the other
territories above mentioned in a north-easterly direction,
Darius and his army are next marched back a prodigious distance
in a north-westerly direction, through the territories of the
Melanchlæni, the Androphagi, and the Neuri, all of whom flee
affrighted into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[p. 267]</span>
the northern desert, having been thus compelled against their will
to share in the consequences of the war. The Agathyrsi peremptorily
require the Scythians to abstain from drawing the Persians into
<i>their</i> territory, on pain of being themselves treated as enemies:<a
id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> the
Scythians in consequence respect the boundaries of the Agathyrsi,
and direct their retreat in such a manner as to draw the Persians
again southward into Scythia. During all this long march backwards
and forwards, there are partial skirmishes and combats of horse,
but the Scythians steadily refuse any general engagement. And
though Darius challenges them formally, by means of a herald,
with taunts of cowardice, the Scythian king Idanthyrsus not only
refuses battle, but explains and defends his policy, and defies the
Persian to come and destroy the tombs of their fathers,—it will
then, he adds, be seen whether the Scythians are cowards or not.<a
id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a>
The difficulties of Darius have by this time become serious, when
Idanthyrsus sends to him the menacing presents of a bird, a mouse, a
frog, and five arrows: the Persians are obliged to commence a rapid
retreat towards the Danube, leaving, in order to check and slacken
the Scythian pursuit, the least effective and the sick part of
their army encamped, together with the asses which had been brought
with them,—animals unknown to the Scythians, and causing great
alarm by their braying.<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494"
class="fnanchor">[494]</a> However, notwithstanding some delay thus
caused, as well as the anxious haste of Darius to reach the Danube,
the Scythians, far more rapid in their movements, arrive at the river
before him, and open a negotiation with the Ionians left in guard
of the bridge, urging them to break it down and leave the Persian
king to his fate,—inevitable destruction with his whole army.<a
id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[p. 268]</span>Here we
reënter the world of reality, at the north bank of the Danube, the
place where we before quitted it. All that is reported to have passed
in the interval, if tried by the tests of historical matter of
fact, can be received as nothing better than a perplexing dream. It
only acquires value when we consider it as an illustrative fiction,
including, doubtless, some unknown matter of fact, but framed chiefly
to exhibit in action those unattackable Nomads, who formed the
north-eastern barbarous world of a Greek, and with whose manners
Herodotus was profoundly struck. “The Scythians<a id="FNanchor_496"
href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> (says he) in regard
to one of the greatest of human matters, have struck out a plan
cleverer than any that I know. In other respects I do not admire
them; but they have contrived this great object, that no invader of
their country shall ever escape out of it, or shall ever be able
to find out and overtake them, unless they themselves choose. For
when men have neither walls nor established cities, but are all
house-carriers and horse-bowmen,—living, not from the plough, but
from cattle, and having their dwellings on wagons,—how can they be
otherwise than unattackable and impracticable to meddle with?” The
protracted and unavailing chase ascribed to Darius,—who can neither
overtake his game nor use his arms, and who hardly even escapes in
safety,—embodies in detail this formidable attribute of the Scythian
Nomads. That Darius actually marched into the country, there can be
no doubt. Nothing else is certain, except his ignominious retreat
out of it to the Danube; for of the many different guesses,<a
id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> by
which critics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[p. 269]</span>
have attempted to cut down the gigantic sketch of Herodotus into a
march with definite limits and direction, not one rests upon any
positive grounds, or carries the least conviction. We can trace the
pervading idea in the mind of the historian, but cannot find out what
were his substantive data.</p>

<p>The adventures which took place at the passage of that river,
both on the out-march and the home-march, wherein the Ionians are
concerned, are far more within the limits of history. Here Herodotus
possessed better means of information, and had less of a dominant
idea to illustrate. That which passed between Darius and the Ionians
on his first crossing is very curious: I have reserved it until
the present moment, because it is particularly connected with the
incidents which happened on his return.</p>

<p>On reaching the Danube from Thrace, he found the bridge of
boats ready, and when the whole army had passed over, he ordered
the Ionians to break it down, as well as to follow him in his
land-march into Scythia;<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498"
class="fnanchor">[498]</a> the ships being left with nothing but
the rowers and seamen essential to navigate them homeward.<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[p. 270]</span> His order was on the
point of being executed, when, fortunately for him, the Mitylenæan
general Kôês ventured to call in question the prudence of it, having
first asked whether it was the pleasure of the Persian king to listen
to advice. He urged that the march on which they were proceeding
might prove perilous, and retreat possibly unavoidable; because the
Scythians, though certain to be defeated if brought to action, might
perhaps not suffer themselves to be approached or even discovered.
As a precaution against all contingencies, it was prudent to leave
the bridge standing and watched by those who had constructed it.
Far from being offended at the advice, Darius felt grateful for it,
and desired that Kôês would ask him after his return for a suitable
reward,—which we shall hereafter find granted. He then altered his
resolution, took a cord, and tied sixty knots in it. “Take this
cord (said he to the Ionians), untie one of the knots in it each
day after my advance from the Danube into Scythia. Remain here and
guard the bridge until you shall have untied all the knots; but if by
that time I shall not have returned, then depart and sail home.”<a
id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a>
After such orders he began his march into the interior.</p>

<p>This anecdote is interesting, not only as it discloses the simple
expedients for numeration and counting of time then practised, but
also as it illustrates the geographical ideas prevalent. Darius did
not intend to come back over the Danube, but to march round the
Mæotis, and to return into Persia on the eastern side of the Euxine.
No other explanation can be given of his orders. At first, confident
of success, he orders the bridge to be destroyed forthwith: he
will beat the Scythians, march through their country, and reënter
Media from the eastern side of the Euxine. When he is reminded that
possibly he may not be able to find the Scythians, and may be obliged
to retreat, he still continues persuaded that this must happen within
sixty days, if it happens at all; and that, should he remain absent
more than sixty days, such delay will be a convincing proof that he
will take the other road of return instead of repassing the Danube.
The reader<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[p. 271]</span> who
looks at a map of the Euxine and its surrounding territories may be
startled at so extravagant a conception. But he should recollect
that there was no map of the same or nearly the same accuracy before
Herodotus, much less before the contemporaries of Darius. The idea
of entering Media by the north from Scythia and Sarmatia over the
Caucasus, is familiar to Herodotus in his sketch of the early marches
of the Scythians and Cimmerians: moreover, he tells us that after
the expedition of Darius, there came some Scythian envoys to Sparta,
proposing an offensive alliance against Persia, and offering on
their part to march across the Phasis into Media from the north,<a
id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a>
while the Spartans were invited to land on the shores of Asia Minor,
and advance across the country to meet them from the west. When we
recollect that the Macedonians and their leader, Alexander the Great,
having arrived at the river Jaxartês, on the north of Sogdiana,
and on the east of the sea of Aral, supposed that they had reached
the Tanais, and called the river by that name,<a id="FNanchor_501"
href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a>—we shall not be
astonished at the erroneous estimation of distance implied in the
plan conceived by Darius.</p>

<p>The Ionians had already remained in guard of the bridge beyond the
sixty days commanded, without hearing anything of the Persian army,
when they were surprised by the appearance, not of that army, but
of a body of Scythians, who acquainted them that Darius was in full
retreat and in the greatest distress, and that his safety with the
whole army depended upon that bridge. They endeavored to prevail upon
the Ionians, since the sixty days included in their order to remain
had now elapsed, to break the bridge and retire; assuring them that,
if this were done, the destruction of the Persians was inevitable,—of
course, the Ionians themselves would then be free. At first, the
latter were favorably disposed towards the proposition, which was
warmly espoused by the Athenian Miltiadês, despot, or governor, of
the Thracian Chersonese.<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502"
class="fnanchor">[502]</a> Had he prevailed, the victor of
Marathon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[p. 272]</span>—for such
we shall hereafter find him—would have thus inflicted a much more
vital blow on Persia than even that celebrated action, and would have
brought upon Darius the disastrous fate of his predecessor Cyrus. But
the Ionian princes, though leaning at first towards his suggestion,
were speedily converted by the representations of Histiæus of
Milêtus, who reminded them that the maintenance of his own ascendency
over the Milesians, and that of each despot in his respective city,
was assured by means of Persian support alone,—the feeling of the
population being everywhere against them: consequently, the ruin of
Darius would be their ruin also. This argument proved conclusive.
It was resolved to stay and maintain the bridge, but to pretend
compliance with the Scythians, and prevail upon them to depart,
by affecting to destroy it. The northern portion of the bridge
was accordingly destroyed, for the length of a bow-shot, and the
Scythians departed under the persuasion that they had succeeded
in depriving their enemies of the means of crossing the river.<a
id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a>
It appears that they missed the track of the retreating host, which
was thus enabled, after the severest privation and suffering, to
reach the Danube in safety. Arriving during the darkness of the
night, Darius was at first terrified to find the bridge no longer
joining the northern bank: an Egyptian herald, of stentorian powers
of voice, was ordered to call as loudly as possible the name of
Histiæus the Milesian. Answer being speedily made, the bridge was
reëstablished, and the Persian army passed over before the Scythians
returned to the spot.<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504"
class="fnanchor">[504]</a></p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the Ionians here lost an opportunity
eminently favorable, such as never again returned, for emancipating
themselves from the Persian dominion. Their despots, by whom the
determination was made, especially the Milesian Histiæus, were
not induced to preserve the bridge by any honorable reluctance to
betray the trust reposed in them, but simply by selfish regard to
the maintenance of their own unpopular dominion. And we may remark
that the real character of this impelling motive, as well as the
deliberation accompanying it, may be assumed as resting upon very
good evidence, since we are now arrived within the personal knowledge
of the Milesian historian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[p.
273]</span> Hekatæus, who took an active part in the Ionic revolt
a few years afterwards, and who may, perhaps, have been personally
engaged in this expedition. He will be found reviewing with prudence
and sobriety the chances of that unfortunate revolt, and distrusting
its success from the beginning; while Histiæus of Milêtus will
appear on the same occasion as the fomenter of it, in order to
procure his release from an honorable detention at Susa, near the
person of Darius. The selfishness of this despot having deprived his
countrymen of that real and favorable chance of emancipation which
the destruction of the bridge would have opened to them, threw them
into perilous revolt a few years afterwards against the entire and
unembarrassed force of the Persian king and empire.</p>

<p>Extricated from the perils of Scythian warfare, Darius marched
southward from the Danube through Thrace to the Hellespont, where he
crossed from Sestus into Asia. He left, however, a considerable army
in Europe, under the command of Megabazus, to accomplish the conquest
of Thrace. Perinthus on the Propontis made a brave resistance,<a
id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a>
but was at length subdued, and it appears that all the Thracian
tribes, and all the Grecian colonies between the Hellespont and
the Strymon, were forced to submit, giving earth and water, and
becoming subject to tribute.<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506"
class="fnanchor">[506]</a> Near the lower Strymon, was the Edonian
town of Myrkinus, which Darius ordered to be made over to Histiæus
of Milêtus; for both this Milesian, and Kôês of Mitylênê, had been
desired by the Persian king to name their own reward for their
fidelity to him on the passage over the Danube.<a id="FNanchor_507"
href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> Kôês requested that
he might be constituted despot of Mitylênê, which was accomplished
by Persian authority; but Histiæus solicited that the territory near
Myrkinus might be given to him for the foundation of a colony. As
soon as the Persian conquests extended thus far, the site in question
was presented to Histiæus, who entered actively upon his new scheme.
We shall find the territory near Myrkinus eminent hereafter as the
site of Amphipolis. It offered great temptation to settlers, as
fertile, well wooded, convenient for maritime commerce, and near to
auriferous and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[p. 274]</span>
argentiferous mountains.<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508"
class="fnanchor">[508]</a> It seems, however, that the Persian
dominion in Thrace was disturbed by an invasion of the Scythians,
who, in revenge for the aggression of Darius, overran the country
as far as the Thracian Chersonese, and are even said to have sent
envoys to Sparta proposing a simultaneous invasion of Persia from
different sides, by Spartans and Scythians. The Athenian Miltiadês,
who was despot, or governor, of the Chersonese, was forced to quit
it for some time, and Herodotus ascribes his retirement to the
incursion of these Nomads. But we may be permitted to suspect that
the historian has misconceived the real cause of such retirement.
Miltiadês could not remain in the Chersonese after he had incurred
the deadly enmity of Darius by exhorting the Ionians to destroy the
bridge over the Danube.<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509"
class="fnanchor">[509]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[p. 275]</span>Nor did the
conquests of Megabazus stop at the western bank of the Strymon. He
carried his arms across that river, conquer<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_276">[p. 276]</span>ing the Pæonians, and reducing the
Macedonians under Amyntas to tribute. A considerable number of the
Pæonians were transported across into Asia, by express order of
Darius; whose fancy had been struck by seeing at Sardis a beautiful
Pæonian woman carrying a vessel on her head, leading a horse to
water, and spinning flax, all at the same time. This woman had
been brought over, we are told, by her two brothers, Pigrês and
Mantyês, for the express purpose of arresting the attention of the
Great King. They hoped by this means to be constituted despots of
their countrymen, and we may presume that their scheme succeeded,
for such part of the Pæonians as Megabazus could subdue were
conveyed across to Asia and planted in some villages in Phrygia.
Such violent transportations of inhabitants were in the genius of
the Persian government.<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510"
class="fnanchor">[510]</a></p>

<p>From the Pæonian lake Prasias, seven eminent Persians were sent
as envoys into Macedonia, to whom Amyntas readily gave the required
token of submission, inviting them to a splendid banquet. When
exhilarated with wine, they demanded to see the women of the regal
family, who, being accordingly introduced, were rudely dealt with by
the strangers. At length, the son of Amyntas, Alexander, resented the
insult, and exacted for it a signal vengeance. Dismissing the women,
under pretence that they should return after a bath, he brought back
in their place youths in female attire, armed with daggers: the
Persians, proceeding to repeat their caresses, were all put to death.
Their retinue and splendid carriages and equipment which they had
brought with them disappeared at the same time, without any tidings
reaching the Persian army. And when Bubarês, another eminent Persian,
was sent into Macedonia to institute researches, Alexander contrived
to hush up the proceeding by large bribes, and by giving him his
sister Gygæa in marriage.<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511"
class="fnanchor">[511]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile Megabazus crossed over into Asia, carrying with
him the Pæonians from the river Strymon. Having been in<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[p. 277]</span> those regions, he
had become alarmed at the progress of Histiæus with his new city
of Myrkinus, and communicated his apprehensions to Darius; who was
prevailed upon to send for Histiæus, retaining him about his person,
and carrying him to Susa as counsellor and friend, with every mark
of honor, but with the secret intention of never letting him revisit
Asia Minor. The fears of the Persian general were probably not
unreasonable; but this detention of Histiæus at Susa, became in the
sequel an important event.<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512"
class="fnanchor">[512]</a></p>

<p>On departing for his capital, Darius nominated his brother
Artaphernês satrap of Sardis, and Otanês, general of the forces on
the coast, in place of Megabazus. The new general dealt very severely
with various towns near the Propontis, on the ground that they had
evaded their duty in the late Scythian expedition, and had even
harassed the army of Darius in its retreat. He took Byzantium and
Chalkêdon, as well as Antandrus in the Troad, and Lampônium; and
with the aid of a fleet from Lesbos, he achieved a new conquest,—the
islands of Lemnos and Imbros, at that time occupied by a Pelasgic
population, seemingly without any Greek inhabitants at all.</p>

<p>These Pelasgi were of cruel and piratical character, if we
may judge by the tenor of the legends respecting them; Lemnian
misdeeds being cited as a proverbial expression for atrocities.<a
id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a>
They were distinguished also for ancient worship of Hêphæstus,
together with mystic rites in honor of the Kabeiri, and even human
sacrifices to their Great Goddess. In their two cities,—Hephæstias on
the east of the island, and Myrina on the west,—they held out bravely
against Otanês, nor did they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[p.
278]</span> submit until they had undergone long and severe
hardship. Lykarêtus, brother of that Mæandrius whom we have
already noticed as despot of Samos, was named governor of Lemnos;
but he soon after died.<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514"
class="fnanchor">[514]</a> It is probable that the Pelasgic
population of the islands was greatly enfeebled during this struggle,
and we even hear that their king Hermon voluntarily emigrated,
from fear of Darius.<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515"
class="fnanchor">[515]</a></p>

<p>Lemnos and Imbros thus became Persian possessions, held by a
subordinate prince as tributary. A few years afterwards their lot was
again changed,—they passed into the hands of Athens, the Pelasgic
inhabitants were expelled, and fresh Athenian settlers introduced.
They were conquered by Miltiadês from the Thracian Chersonese; from
Elæus at the south of that peninsula to Lemnos being within less
than one day’s sail with a north wind. The Hephæstieans abandoned
their city and evacuated the island with little resistance; but
the inhabitants of Myrina stood a siege,<a id="FNanchor_516"
href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> and were not expelled
without difficulty: both of them found abodes in Thrace, on and near
the peninsula of Mount Athos. Both these islands, together with that
of Skyros (which was not taken until after the invasion of Xerxês),
remained connected with Athens in a manner peculiarly intimate. At
the peace of Antalkidas (387 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>),—which guaranteed
universal autonomy to every Grecian city, great and small,—they
were specially reserved, and considered as united with Athens.<a
id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a>
The property in their soil was held by men who, without losing
their Athenian citizenship, became Lemnian kleruchs, and as such
were classified apart among the military force of the state; while
absence in Lemnos or Imbros seems to have been<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_279">[p. 279]</span> accepted as an excuse for delay before
the courts of justice, so as to escape the penalties of contumacy, or
departure from the country.<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518"
class="fnanchor">[518]</a> It is probable that a considerable number
of poor Athenian citizens were provided with lots of land in these
islands, though we have no direct information of the fact, and are
even obliged to guess the precise time at which Miltiadês made the
conquest. Herodotus, according to his usual manner, connects the
conquest with an ancient oracle, and represents it as the retribution
for ancient legendary crime committed by certain Pelasgi, who, many
centuries before, had been expelled by the Athenians from Attica,
and had retired to Lemnos. Full of this legend, he tells us nothing
about the proximate causes or circumstances of the conquest, which
must probably have been accomplished by the efforts of Athens,
jointly with Miltiadês from the Chersonese, daring the period that
the Persians were occupied in quelling the Ionic revolt, between
502-494 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,—since it is hardly to be supposed
that Miltiadês would have ventured thus to attack a Persian
possession during the time that the satraps had their hands free. The
acquisition was probably facilitated by the fact, that the Pelasgic
population of the islands had been weakened, as well by their former
resistance to the Persian Otanês, as by some years passed under the
deputy of a Persian satrap.</p>

<p>In mentioning the conquest of Lemnos by the Athenians and<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[p. 280]</span> Miltiadês, I have
anticipated a little on the course of events, because that
conquest,—though coinciding in point of time with the Ionic revolt
(which will be recounted in the following chapter), and indirectly
caused by it, in so far as it occupied the attention of the
Persians,—lies entirely apart from the operations of the revolted
Ionians. When Miltiadês was driven out of the Chersonese by the
Persians, on the suppression of the Ionic revolt, his fame, derived
from having subdued Lemnos,<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519"
class="fnanchor">[519]</a> contributed both to neutralize the
enmity which he had incurred as governor of the Chersonese, and to
procure his election as one of the ten generals for the year of the
Marathonian combat.</p>

<div class="chapter pt3" id="Chap_35">
  <h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXV.<br />
    IONIC REVOLT.</h2>
</div>

<p class="mt1"><span class="smcap">Hitherto</span>, the history of
the Asiatic Greeks has flowed in a stream distinct from that of
the European Greeks. The present chapter will mark the period of
confluence between the two.</p>

<p>At the time when Darius quitted Sardis on his return to Susa,
carrying with him the Milesian Histiæus, he left Artaphernês, his
brother, as satrap of Sardis, invested with the supreme command of
Western Asia Minor. The Grecian cities on the coast, comprehended
under his satrapy, appear to have been chiefly governed by native
despots in each; and Milêtus especially, in the absence of Histiæus,
was ruled by his son-in-law Aristagoras. That city was now in the
height of power and prosperity,—in every respect the leading city
of Ionia. The return of Darius to Susa may be placed seemingly
about 512 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, from which time forward the state
of things above described continued, without disturbance, for eight
or ten years,—“a respite from suffering,” to use the significant
phrase of the historian.<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520"
class="fnanchor">[520]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[p. 281]</span>It was about
the year 506 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, that the exiled Athenian despot
Hippias, after having been repelled from Sparta by the unanimous
refusal of the Lacedæmonian allies to take part in his cause,
presented himself from Sigeium as a petitioner to Artaphernês at
Sardis. He now, doubtless, found the benefit of the alliance which he
had formed for his daughter with the despot Æantidês of Lampsakus,
whose favor with Darius would stand him in good stead. He made
pressing representations to the satrap, with a view of procuring
restoration to Athens, on condition of holding it under Persian
dominion; and Artaphernês was prepared, if an opportunity offered,
to aid him in his design. So thoroughly had he resolved on espousing
actively the cause of Hippias, that when the Athenians despatched
envoys to Sardis, to set forth the case of the city against its
exiled pretender, he returned to them an answer not merely of
denial, but of menace,—bidding them receive Hippias back again, if
they looked for safety.<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521"
class="fnanchor">[521]</a> Such a reply was equivalent to a
declaration of war,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[p.
282]</span> and so it was construed at Athens. It leads us to infer
that he was even then revolving in his mind an expedition against
Attica, in conjunction with Hippias; but, fortunately for the
Athenians, other projects and necessities intervened to postpone for
several years the execution of the scheme.</p>

<p>Of these new projects, the first was that of conquering the island
of Naxos. Here, too, as in the case of Hippias, the instigation
arose from Naxian exiles,—a rich oligarchy which had been expelled
by a rising of the people. This island, like all the rest of the
Cyclades, was as yet independent of the Persians.<a id="FNanchor_522"
href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> It was wealthy,
prosperous, possessing a large population both of freemen and slaves,
and defended as well by armed ships as by a force of eight thousand
heavy-armed infantry. The exiles applied for aid to Aristagoras,
who saw that he could turn them into instruments of dominion for
himself in the island, provided he could induce Artaphernês to embark
in the project along with him,—his own force not being adequate by
itself. Accordingly, he went to Sardis, and laid his project before
the satrap, intimating that as soon as the exiles should land with
a powerful support, Naxos would be reduced with little trouble:
that the neighboring islands of Paros, Andros, Tênos, and the other
Cyclades, could not long hold out after the conquest of Naxos, nor
even the large and valuable island of Eubœa. He himself engaged,
if a fleet of one hundred ships were granted to him, to accomplish
all these conquests for the Great King, and to bear the expenses of
the armament besides. Artaphernês warmly entered into the scheme,
loaded him with praise, and promised him in the ensuing spring two
hundred ships instead of one hundred. A messenger despatched to Susa,
having brought back the ready consent of Darius, a large armament
was forthwith equipped, under the command of the Persian Megabatês,
to be placed at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[p. 283]</span>
the disposal of Aristagoras,—composed both of Persians and of all the
tributaries near the coast.<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523"
class="fnanchor">[523]</a></p>

<p>With this force Aristagoras and the Naxian exiles set sail from
Milêtus, giving out that they were going to the Hellespont. On
reaching Chios, they waited in its western harbor of Kaukasa for
a fair wind to carry them straight across to Naxos. No suspicion
was entertained in that island of its real purpose, nor was any
preparation made for resistance, and the success of Aristagoras
would have been complete, had it not been defeated by an untoward
incident ending in dispute. Megabatês, with a solicitude which we
are surprised to discern in a Persian general, personally made the
tour of his fleet, to see that every ship was under proper watch,
and discovered a ship from Myndus (an Asiatic Dorian city near
Halikarnassus), left without a single man on board. Incensed at this
neglect, he called before him Skylax, the commander of the ship, and
ordered him to be put in chains, with his head projecting outwards
through one of the apertures for oars in the ship’s side. Skylax
was a guest and friend of Aristagoras, who, on hearing of this
punishment, interceded with Megabatês for his release; but finding
the request refused, took upon him to release the prisoner himself.
He even went so far as to treat the remonstrance of Megabatês with
disdain, reminding him that, according to the instructions of
Artaphernês, he was only second and himself (Aristagoras) first.
The pride of Megabatês could not endure such treatment: as soon as
night arrived, he sent a private intimation to Naxos of the coming of
the fleet, warning the islanders to be on their guard. The warning
thus fortunately received was turned by the Naxians to the best
account. They carried in their property, laid up stores, and made
every preparation for a siege, so that when the fleet, probably
delayed by the dispute between its leaders, at length arrived, it
was met by a stout resistance, remained on the shore of the island
for four months in prosecution of an unavailing siege, and was
obliged to retire without accomplishing anything beyond the erection
of a fort, as lodgment for the Naxian exiles. After a large cost
incurred, not only by the Persians, but also by<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_284">[p. 284]</span> Aristagoras himself, the unsuccessful
armament was brought back to the coast of Ionia.<a id="FNanchor_524"
href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a></p>

<p>The failure of this expedition threatened Aristagoras with entire
ruin. He had incensed Megabatês, deceived Artaphernês, and incurred
an obligation, which he knew not how to discharge, of indemnifying
the latter for the costs of the fleet. He began to revolve in his
mind the scheme of revolting from Persia, when it so happened
that there arrived nearly at the same moment a messenger from his
father-in-law, Histiæus, who was detained at the court of Susa,
secretly instigating him to this very resolution. Not knowing whom to
trust with this dangerous message, Histiæus had caused the head of a
faithful slave to be shaved,—branded upon it the words necessary,—and
then despatched him, so soon as his hair had grown, to Milêtus,
with a verbal intimation to Aristagoras that his head was to be
again shaved and examined.<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525"
class="fnanchor">[525]</a> Histiæus sought to provoke this perilous
rising, simply as a means of procuring his own release from Susa,
and in the calculation that Darius would send him down to the
coast to reëstablish order. His message, arriving at so critical
a moment, determined the faltering resolution of Aristagoras, who
convened his principal partisans at Milêtus, and laid before them
the formidable project of revolt. All of them approved it, with one
remarkable exception,—the historian Hekatæus of Milêtus; who opposed
it as altogether ruinous, and contended that the power of Darius
was too vast to leave them any prospect of success. When he found
direct opposition fruitless, he next insisted upon the necessity of
at once seizing the large treasures in the neighboring temple of
Apollo, at Branchidæ, for the purpose of carrying on the revolt.
By this means alone, he said, could the Milesians, too feeble to
carry on the contest with their own force alone, hope to become
masters at sea,—while, if <i>they</i> did not take these treasures, the
victorious enemy surely would. Neither of these recommendations,
both of them indicating sagacity and foresight in the proposer, were
listened to. Probably the seizure of the treasures,—though highly
useful for the impending struggle, and though<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_285">[p. 285]</span> in the end they fell into the hands of
the enemy, as Hekatæus anticipated,—would have been insupportable to
the pious feelings of the people, and would thus have proved more
injurious than beneficial:<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526"
class="fnanchor">[526]</a> perhaps, indeed, Hekatæus himself may have
urged it with the indirect view of stifling the whole project. We may
remark that he seems to have urged the question as if Milêtus were to
stand alone in the revolt; not anticipating, as indeed no prudent man
could then anticipate, that the Ionic cities generally would follow
the example.</p>

<p>Aristagoras and his friends resolved forthwith to revolt, and
their first step was to conciliate popular favor throughout Asiatic
Greece by putting down the despots in all the various cities,—the
instruments not less than the supports of Persian ascendency, as
Histiæus had well urged at the bridge of the Danube. The opportunity
was favorable for striking this blow at once on a considerable scale.
The fleet, recently employed at Naxos, had not yet dispersed, but
was still assembled at Myus, with many of the despots present at
the head of their ships. Iatragoras was despatched from Milêtus,
at once to seize as many of them as he could, and to stir up the
soldiers to revolt. This decisive proceeding was the first manifesto
against Darius. Iatragoras was successful: the fleet went along
with him, and many of the despots fell into his hands,—among
them Histiæus (a second person so named) of Termera, Oliatus of
Mylasa (both Karians),<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527"
class="fnanchor">[527]</a> Kôês of Mitylênê, and Aristagoras (also
a second person so named) of Kymê. At the same time the Milesian
Aristagoras himself, while he formally proclaimed revolt against
Darius, and invited the Milesians to follow him, laid down his own
authority, and affected to place the government in the hands of the
people. Throughout most of the towns of Asiatic Greece, insular and
continental, a similar revolution was brought about; the despots
were expelled, and the feelings of the citizens were thus warmly
interested in the revolt. Such of these despots as fell into the
hands of Aristagoras were surrendered into the hands of their former
subjects, by whom they were for the most part quietly dismissed,
and we shall find them hereafter active auxil<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_286">[p. 286]</span>iaries to the Persians. To this
treatment the only exception mentioned is Kôês, who was stoned to
death by the Mitylenæans.<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528"
class="fnanchor">[528]</a></p>

<p>By these first successful steps the Ionic revolt was made to
assume an extensive and formidable character; much more so, probably,
than the prudent Hekatæus had anticipated as practicable. The naval
force of the Persians in the Ægean was at once taken away from them,
and passed to their opponents, who were thus completely masters of
the sea; and would in fact have remained so, if a second naval force
had not been brought up against them from Phenicia,—a proceeding
never before resorted to, and perhaps at that time not looked for.</p>

<p>Having exhorted all the revolted towns to name their generals,
and to put themselves in a state of defence, Aristagoras crossed the
Ægean to obtain assistance from Sparta, then under the government
of king Kleomenês; to whom he addressed himself, “holding in his
hand a brazen tablet, wherein was engraved the circuit of the
entire earth, with the whole sea and all the rivers.” Probably
this was the first map or plan which had ever been seen at Sparta,
and so profound was the impression which it made, that it was
remembered there even in the time of Herodotus.<a id="FNanchor_529"
href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> Having emphatically
entreated the Spartans to step forth in aid of their Ionic brethren,
now engaged in a desperate struggle for freedom,—he proceeded to
describe the wealth and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[p.
287]</span> abundance (gold, silver, brass, vestments, cattle,
and slaves), together with the ineffective weapons and warfare of
the Asiatics. The latter, he said, could be at once put down, and
the former appropriated, by military training such as that of the
Spartans,—whose long spear, brazen helmet and breastplate, and
ample shield, enabled them to despise the bow, the short javelin,
the light wicker target, the turban and trowsers, of a Persian.<a
id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a>
He then traced out on his brazen plan the road from Ephesus to
Susa, indicating the intervening nations, all of them affording
a booty more or less rich; but he magnified especially the vast
treasures at Susa: “Instead of fighting your neighbors, he concluded,
Argeians, Arcadians, and Messenians, from whom you get hard blows
and small reward, why do you not make yourself ruler of all Asia,<a
id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a>
a prize not less easy than lucrative?” Kleomenês replied to these
seductive instigations by desiring him to come for an answer on the
third day. When that day arrived, he put to him the simple question,
how far it was from Susa to the sea? To which Aristagoras answered,
with more frankness than dexterity, that it was a three months’
journey; and he was proceeding to enlarge upon the facilities of the
road when Kleomenês interrupted him: “Quit Sparta before sunset,
Milesian stranger; you are no friend to the Lacedæmonians, if you
want to carry them a three months’ journey from the sea.” In spite of
this peremptory mandate, Aristagoras tried a last resource: he took
in his hand the bough of supplication, and again went to the house of
Kleomenês, who was sitting with his daughter Gorgô, a girl of eight
years old. He requested Kleomenês to send away the child, but this
was refused, and he was desired to proceed; upon which he began to
offer to the Spartan king a bribe for compliance, bidding continually
higher and higher from ten talents up to fifty. At length, the
little girl suddenly ex<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[p.
288]</span>claimed, “Father, the stranger will corrupt you, if you do
not at once go away.” The exclamation so struck Kleomenês, that he
broke up the interview, and Aristagoras forthwith quitted Sparta.<a
id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a></p>

<p>Doubtless Herodotus heard the account of this interview from
Lacedæmonian informants. But we may be permitted to doubt, whether
any such suggestions were really made, or any such hopes held out,
as those which he places in the mouth of Aristagoras,—suggestions
and hopes which might well be conceived in 450-440 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, after a generation of victories over the Persians, but
which have no pertinence in the year 502 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> Down
even to the battle of Marathon, the name of the Medes was a terror
to the Greeks, and the Athenians are highly and justly extolled as
the first who dared to look them in the face.<a id="FNanchor_533"
href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> To talk about an easy
march up to the treasures of Susa and the empire of all Asia, at the
time of the Ionic revolt, would have been considered as a proof of
insanity. Aristagoras may very probably have represented, that the
Spartans were more than a match for Persians in the field; but even
thus much would have been considered, in 502 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,
rather as the sanguine hope of a petitioner than as the estimate of a
sober looker-on.</p>

<p>The Milesian chief had made application to Sparta, as the
presiding power of Hellas,—a character which we thus find more
and more recognized and passing into the habitual feeling of the
Greeks. Fifty years previously to this, the Spartans had been
flattered by the circumstance, that Crœsus singled them out from all
other Greeks to invite as allies: now they accepted such priority
as a matter of course.<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534"
class="fnanchor">[534]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[p. 289]</span>Rejected at
Sparta, Aristagoras proceeded to Athens, now decidedly the second
power in Greece. And here he found an easier task, not only as it
was the metropolis, or mother-city, of Asiatic Ionia, but also as
it had already incurred the pronounced hostility of the Persian
satrap, and might look to be attacked as soon as the project came to
suit his convenience, under the instigation of Hippias: whereas the
Spartans had not only no kindred with Ionia, beyond that of common
Hellenism, but were in no hostile relations with Persia, and would
have been provoking a new enemy by meddling in the Asiatic war.
The promises and representations of Aristagoras were accordingly
received with great favor by the Athenians: who, over and above
the claims of sympathy, had a powerful interest in sustaining the
Ionic revolt as an indirect protection to themselves,—and to whom
the abstraction of the Ionic fleet from the Persians afforded a
conspicuous and important relief. The Athenians at once resolved
to send a fleet of twenty ships, under Melanthius, as an aid to
the revolted Ionians,—ships which are styled by Herodotus, “the
beginning of the mischiefs between Greeks and barbarians,”—as the
ships in which Paris crossed the Ægean had before been called in
the Iliad of Homer. Herodotus farther remarks that it seems easier
to deceive many men together than one,—since Aristagoras, after
having failed with Kleomenês, thus imposed upon the thirty thousand
citizens of Athens.<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535"
class="fnanchor">[535]</a> But on this remark two comments suggest
themselves. First, the circumstances of Athens and Sparta were
not the same in regard to the Ionic quarrel,—an observation which
Herodotus himself had made a little while before: the Athenians
had a material interest in the quarrel, political as well as<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[p. 290]</span> sympathetic, while
the Spartans had none. Secondly, the ultimate result of their
interference, as it stood in the time of Herodotus, though purchased
by severe intermediate hardship, was one eminently gainful and
glorifying, not less to Athens than to Greece.<a id="FNanchor_536"
href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a></p>

<p>When Aristagoras returned, he seems to have found the Persians
engaged in the siege of Milêtus. The twenty Athenian ships soon
crossed the Ægean, and found there five Eretrian ships which had
also come to the succor of the Ionians; the Eretrians generously
taking this opportunity to repay assistance formerly rendered to
them by the Milesians in their ancient war with Chalkis. On the
arrival of these allies, Aristagoras organized an expedition from
Ephesus up to Sardis, under the command of his brother Charopinus,
with others. The ships were left at Korêssus,<a id="FNanchor_537"
href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> a mountain and
seaport five miles from Ephesus, while the troops marched up under
Ephesian guides, first, along the river Kayster, next, across the
mountain range of Tmôlus to Sardis. Artaphernês had not troops
enough to do more than hold the strong citadel, so that the
assailants possessed themselves of the town without opposition. But
he immediately recalled his force near Miletus,<a id="FNanchor_538"
href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> and summoned Persians
and Lydians from all the neighboring districts, thus becoming more
than a match for Charopinus; who found himself, moreover, obliged
to evacuate Sardis, owing to an accidental conflagration. Most of
the houses in that city were built in great part with reeds or
straw, and all of them had thatched roofs; hence it happened that
a spark touching one of them set the whole city in flame. Obliged
to abandon their dwellings by this accident, the population of the
town congregated in the market-place,—and as reinforcements were
hourly crowding in, the position of the Ionians and Athe<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[p. 291]</span>nians became precarious:
they evacuated the town, took up a position on Mount Tmôlus, and,
when night came, made the best of their way to the sea-coast. The
troops of Artaphernês pursued, overtook them near Ephesus, and
defeated them completely. Eualkidês, the Eretrian general, a man of
eminence and a celebrated victor at the solemn games, perished in
the action, together with a considerable number of troops. After
this unsuccessful commencement, the Athenians betook themselves to
their vessels and sailed home, in spite of pressing instances on the
part of Aristagoras to induce them to stay. They took no farther
part in the struggle;<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539"
class="fnanchor">[539]</a> a retirement at once so sudden and so
complete, that they must probably have experienced some glaring
desertion on the part of their Asiatic allies, similar to that which
brought so much danger upon the Spartan general Derkyllidas, in 396
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> Unless such was the case, they seem open to
censure rather for having too soon withdrawn their aid, than for
having originally lent it.<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540"
class="fnanchor">[540]</a></p>

<p>The burning of a place so important as Sardis, however,
including the temples of the local goddess Kybêbê, which perished
with the remaining buildings, produced a powerful effect on both
sides,—encouraging the revolters, as well as incensing the Persians.
Aristagoras despatched ships along the coast, northward as far as
Byzantium, and southward as far as Cyprus. The Greek cities near
the Hellespont and the Propontis were induced, either by force or
by inclination, to take part with him: the Karians embraced his
cause warmly; even the Kaunians, who had not declared themselves
before, joined him as soon as they heard of the capture of Sardis;
while the Greeks in Cyprus, with the single exception of the town
of Amathûs, at once renounced the authority of Darius, and prepared
for a strenuous contest. Onesilus of Salamis, the most considerable
city in the island,—finding the population willing, but his brother,
the despot Gorgus, reluctant,—shut the latter out of the gates, took
the command of the united forces of Salamis and other revolting
cities, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[p. 292]</span> laid
siege to Amathûs. These towns of Cyprus were then, and seem always
afterwards to have continued, under the government of despots; who,
however, unlike the despots in Ionia generally, took part along with
their subjects in the revolt against Persia.<a id="FNanchor_541"
href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a></p>

<p>The rebellion had now assumed a character more serious than
ever, and the Persians were compelled to put forth their strongest
efforts to subdue it. From the number of different nations
comprised in their empire, they were enabled to make use of the
antipathies of one against the other; and the old adverse feeling
of Phenicians against Greeks was now found extremely serviceable.
After a year spent in getting together forces,<a id="FNanchor_542"
href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> the Phenician
fleet was employed to transport into Cyprus the Persian general
Artybius with a Kilikian and Egyptian army,<a id="FNanchor_543"
href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a>—while the force under
Artaphernês at Sardis was so strengthened as to enable him to act
at once against all the coast of Asia Minor, from the Propontis to
the Triopian promontory. On the other side, the common danger had
for the moment brought the Ionians into a state of union foreign to
their usual habit, and we hear now, for the first and the last time,
of a tolerably efficient Pan-Ionic authority.<a id="FNanchor_544"
href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a></p>

<p>Apprized of the coming of Artybius with the Phenician fleet,
Onesilus and his Cyprian supporters solicited the aid of the Ionic
fleet, which arrived shortly after the disembarkation of the Persian
force in the island. Onesilus offered to the Ionians their choice,
whether they would fight the Phenicians at sea or the Persians on
land. Their natural determination was in favor of the seafight,
and they engaged with a degree of courage and unanimity<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[p. 293]</span> which procured for them
a brilliant victory; the Samians being especially distinguished.<a
id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> But
the combat on land, carried on at the same time, took a different
turn. Onesilus and the Salaminians brought into the field, after
the fashion of Orientals rather than of Greeks, a number of scythed
chariots, destined to break the enemy’s ranks; while on the other
hand the Persian general Artybius was mounted on a horse, trained
to rise on his hind legs and strike out with his fore legs against
an opponent on foot. In the thick of the fight, Onesilus and his
Karian shield-bearer came into personal conflict with this general
and his horse; and by previous concert, when the horse so reared as
to get his fore legs over the shield of Onesilus, the Karian with
a scythe severed the legs from his body, while Onesilus with his
own hand slew Artybius. But the personal bravery of the Cypriots
was rendered useless by treachery in their own ranks. Stêsênor,
despot of Kurium, deserted in the midst of the battle, and even the
scythed chariots of Salamis followed his example. The brave Onesilus,
thus weakened, perished in the total rout of his army, along with
Aristokyprus despot of Soli, on the north coast of the island: this
latter being son of that Philokyprus who had been immortalized more
than sixty years before, in the poems of Solon. No farther hopes now
remained for the revolters, and the victorious Ionian fleet returned
home. Salamis relapsed under the sway of its former despot Gorgus,
while the remaining cities in Cyprus were successively besieged and
taken: not without a resolute defence, however, since Soli alone
held out five months.<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546"
class="fnanchor">[546]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[p. 294]</span>Meanwhile
the principal force of Darius having been assembled at
Sardis,—Daurisês, Hymeas, and other generals who had married
daughters of the Great King, distributed their efforts against
different parts of the western coast. Daurisês attacked the towns
near the Hellespont,<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547"
class="fnanchor">[547]</a>—Abydus, Perkôtê, Lampsakus, and
Pæsus,—which made little resistance. He was then ordered southward
into Karia, while Hymeas, who, with another division, had taken Kios
on the Propontis, marched down to the Hellespont and completed the
conquest of the Troad as well as of the Æolic Greeks in the region
of Ida. Artaphernês and Otanês attacked the Ionic and Æolic towns
on the coast,—the former taking Klazomenæ,<a id="FNanchor_548"
href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> the latter Kymê.
There remained Karia, which, with Milêtus in its neighborhood,
offered a determined resistance to Daurisês. Forewarned of his
approach, the Karians assembled at a spot called the White Pillars,
near the confluence of the rivers Mæander and Marsyas. Pixodarus,
one of their chiefs, recommended the desperate expedient of fighting
with the river at their back, so that all chance of flight might
be cut off;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[p. 295]</span>
but most of the chiefs decided in favor of a contrary policy,<a
id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a>—to
let the Persians pass the river, in hopes of driving them back into
it and thus rendering their defeat total. Victory, however, after a
sharp contest, declared in favor of Daurisês, chiefly in consequence
of his superior numbers: two thousand Persians, and not less than
ten thousand Karians, are said to have perished in the battle.
The Karian fugitives, reunited after the flight, in the grove of
noble plane-trees consecrated to Zeus Stratius, near Labranda,<a
id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a>
were deliberating whether they should now submit to the Persians or
emigrate forever, when the appearance of a Milesian reinforcement
restored their courage. A second battle was fought, and a second
time they were defeated, the loss on this occasion falling chiefly
on the Milesians.<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551"
class="fnanchor">[551]</a> The victorious Persians now proceeded to
assault Karian cities, but Herakleidês of Mylasa laid an ambuscade
for them with so much skill and good fortune, that their army was
nearly destroyed, and Daurisês with other Persian generals perished.
This successful effort, following upon two severe defeats, does
honor to the constancy of the Karians, upon whom Greek proverbs
generally fasten a mean reputation. It saved for the time the Karian
towns, which the Persians did not succeed in reducing until after
the capture of Milêtus.<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552"
class="fnanchor">[552]</a></p>

<p>On land, the revolters were thus everywhere worsted, though<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[p. 296]</span> at sea the Ionians
still remained masters. But the unwarlike Aristagoras began to
despair of success, and to meditate a mean desertion of the
companions and countrymen whom he had himself betrayed into danger.
Assembling his chief advisers, he represented to them the unpromising
state of affairs, and the necessity of securing some place of
refuge, in case they were expelled from Milêtus. He then put the
question to them, whether the island of Sardinia, or Myrkinus in
Thrace, near the Strymon (which Histiæus had begun some time before
to fortify, as I have mentioned in the preceding chapter), appeared
to them best adapted to the purpose. Among the persons consulted
was Hekatæus the historian, who approved neither the one nor the
other scheme, but suggested the erection of a fortified post in the
neighboring island of Leros; a Milesian colony, wherein a temporary
retirement might be sought, should it prove impossible to hold
Milêtus, but which permitted an easy return to that city, so soon
as opportunity offered.<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553"
class="fnanchor">[553]</a> Such an opinion must doubtless have been
founded on the assumption, that they would be able to maintain
superiority at sea. And it is important to note such confident
reliance upon this superiority in the mind of a sagacious man, not
given to sanguine hopes, like Hekatæus,—even under circumstances
very unprosperous on land. Emigration to Myrkinus, as proposed by
Aristagoras, presented no hope of refuge at all; since the Persians,
if they regained their authority in Asia Minor, would not fail again
to extend it to the Strymon. Nevertheless, the consultation ended
by adopting this scheme, since, probably, no Ionians could endure
the immeasurable distance of Sardinia as a new home. Aristagoras
set sail for Myrkinus, taking with him all who chose to bear him
company; but he perished not long after landing, together with nearly
all his company, in the siege of a neighboring Thracian town.<a
id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a>
Though making profession to lay down his supreme authority at the
commencement of the revolt, he had still contrived to retain it in
great measure; and on departing for Myrkinus, he devolved it on
Pythagoras, a citizen in high esteem. It appears however that the
Milesians, glad to get rid of a leader who had brought them<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[p. 297]</span> nothing but mischief,<a
id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a>
paid little obedience to his successor, and made their government
from this period popular in reality as well as in profession. The
desertion of Aristagoras, with the citizens whom he carried away,
must have seriously damped the spirits of those who remained:
nevertheless, it seems that the cause of the Ionic revolters was
quite as well conducted without him.</p>

<p>Not long after his departure, another despot—Histiæus of Milêtus,
his father-in-law, and jointly with him the fomenter of the
revolt—presented himself at the gates of Milêtus for admission. The
outbreak of the revolt had enabled him, as he had calculated, to
procure leave of departure from Darius. That prince had been thrown
into violent indignation by the attack and burning of Sardis, and
by the general revolt of Ionia, headed (so the news reached him)
by the Milesian Aristagoras, but carried into effect by the active
coöperation of the Athenians. “The Athenians (exclaimed Darius),
who are <i>they</i>?” On receiving the answer, he asked for his bow,
placed an arrow on the string, and shot as high as he could towards
the heavens, saying: “Grant me, Zeus, to revenge myself on the
Athenians.” He at the same time desired an attendant to remind him
thrice every day at dinner: “Master, remember the Athenians;” for
as to the Ionians, he felt assured that their hour of retribution
would come speedily and easily enough.<a id="FNanchor_556"
href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a></p>

<p>This Homeric incident deserves notice as illustrating the epical
handling of Herodotus. His theme is, the invasions of Greece by
Persia: he has now arrived at the first eruption, in the bosom of
Darius, of that passion which impelled the Persian forces towards
Marathon and Salamis,—and he marks the beginning of the new phase
by act and word both alike significant. It may be compared to the
libation and prayer addressed by Achilles in the Iliad to Zeus, at
the moment when he is sending forth Patroklus and the Myrmidons to
the rescue of the despairing Greeks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[p. 298]</span>At first,
Darius had been inclined to ascribe the movement in Ionia to the
secret instigation of Histiæus, whom he called into his presence and
questioned. But the latter found means to satisfy him, and even to
make out that no such mischief would have occurred, if he, Histiæus,
had been at Milêtus instead of being detained at Susa. “Send me
down to the spot, he asseverated, and I engage not merely to quell
the revolt, and put into your hands the traitor who heads it, but
also, not to take off this tunic from my body, before I shall have
added to your empire the great island of Sardinia.” An expedition
to Sardinia, though never realized, appears to have been among the
favorite fancies of the Ionic Greeks of that day.<a id="FNanchor_557"
href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> By such boasts
and assurances he obtained his liberty, and went down to Sardis,
promising to return as soon as he should have accomplished them.<a
id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a></p>

<p>But on reaching Sardis he found the satrap Artaphernês better
informed than the Great King at Susa. Though Histiæus, when
questioned as to the causes which had brought on the outbreak,
affected nothing but ignorance and astonishment, Artaphernês
detected his evasions, and said: “I will tell you how the facts
stand, Histiæus: it is you that have stitched this shoe, and
Aristagoras has put it on.”<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559"
class="fnanchor">[559]</a> Such a declaration promised little
security to the suspected Milesian who heard it; and accordingly,
as soon as night arrived, he took to flight, went down to the
coast, and from thence passed over to Chios. Here he found himself
seized on the opposite count, as the confidant of Darius and the
enemy of Ionia: he was released, however, on proclaiming himself
not merely a fugitive escaping from Persian custody, but also as
the prime author of the Ionic revolt. And<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_299">[p. 299]</span> he farther added, in order to increase
his popularity, that Darius had contemplated the translation of the
Ionian population to Phenicia, as well as that of the Phenician
population to Ionia,—to prevent which translation he, Histiæus, had
instigated the revolt. This allegation, though nothing better than
a pure fabrication, obtained for him the good-will of the Chians,
who carried him back to Milêtus. But before he departed, he avenged
himself on Artaphernês by despatching to Sardis some false letters,
implicating many distinguished Persians in a conspiracy jointly with
himself: these letters were so managed as to fall into the hands of
the satrap himself, who became full of suspicion, and put to death
several of the parties, to the great uneasiness of all around him.<a
id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a></p>

<p>On arriving at Milêtus, Histiæus found Aristagoras no longer
present, and the citizens altogether adverse to the return of their
old despot. Nevertheless, he tried to force his way by night into the
town, but was repulsed and even wounded in the thigh. He returned
to Chios, but the Chians refused him the aid of any of their ships:
he next passed to Lesbos, from the inhabitants of which island he
obtained eight triremes, and employed them to occupy Byzantium,
pillaging and detaining the Ionian merchant-ships as they passed
into or out of the Euxine.<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561"
class="fnanchor">[561]</a> The few remaining piracies of this
worthless traitor, mischievous to his countrymen down to the day
of his death, hardly deserve our notice, amidst the last struggles
and sufferings of the subjugated Ionians, to which we are now
hastening.</p>

<p>A vast Persian force, both military and naval, was gradually
concentrating itself near Milêtus, against which city Artaphernês had
determined to direct his principal efforts. Not only the whole army
of Asia Minor, but also the Kilikian and Egyptian troops fresh from
the conquest of Cyprus, and even the conquered Cypriots themselves,
were brought up as reinforcements; while the entire Phenician fleet,
no less than six hundred ships strong, coöperated on the coast.<a
id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> To
meet such a land-force in the field, being far beyond the strength
of the Ionians, the joint Pan-Ionic council resolved that the
Milesians should be left to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[p.
300]</span> defend their own fortifications, while the entire force
of the confederate cities should be mustered on board the ships. At
sea they had as yet no reason to despair, having been victorious
over the Phenicians near Cyprus, and having sustained no defeat.
The combined Ionic fleet, including the Æolic Lesbians, amounting
in all to the number of three hundred and fifty-three ships, was
accordingly mustered at Ladê,—then a little island near Milêtus,
but now joined on to the coast, by the gradual accumulation of
land in the bay at the mouth of the Mæander. Eighty Milesian ships
formed the right wing, one hundred Chian ships the centre, and sixty
Samian ships the left wing; while the space between the Milesians
and the Chians was occupied by twelve ships from Priênê, three from
Myus, and seventeen from Teôs,—the space between the Chians and
Samians was filled by eight ships from Erythræ, three from Phôkæa,
and seventy from Lesbos.<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563"
class="fnanchor">[563]</a></p>

<p>The total armament thus made up was hardly inferior in number to
that which, fifteen years afterwards, gained the battle of Salamis
against a far larger Persian fleet than the present. Moreover, the
courage of the Ionians, on ship-board, was equal to that of their
contemporaries on the other side of the Ægean; while in respect
of disagreement among the allies, we shall hereafter find the
circumstances preceding the battle of Salamis still more menacing
than those before the coming battle of Ladê. The chances of success,
therefore, were at least equal between the two; and indeed the
anticipations of the Persians and Phenicians on the present occasion
were full of doubt, so that they thought it necessary to set on
foot express means for disuniting the Ionians,—it was fortunate for
the Greeks that Xerxês at Salamis could not be made to conceive the
prudence of aiming at the same object. There were now in the Persian
camp all those various despots whom Aristagoras, at the beginning
of the revolt, had driven out of their respective cities. At the
instigation of Artaphernês, each of these men despatched secret
communications to their citizens in the allied fleet, endeavoring
to detach them severally from the general body, by promises of
gentle treatment in the event of compliance, and by threats of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[p. 301]</span> extreme infliction
from the Persians if they persisted in armed efforts. Though
these communications were sent to each without the knowledge of
the rest, yet the answer from all was one unanimous negative.<a
id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> And
the confederates at Ladê seemed more one, in heart and spirit, than
the Athenians, Spartans, and Corinthians will hereafter prove to be
at Salamis.</p>

<p>But there was one grand difference which turned the scale,—the
superior energy and ability of the Athenian leaders at Salamis,
coupled with the fact that they <i>were</i> Athenians,—that is, in command
of the largest and most important contingent throughout the fleet.</p>

<p>At Ladê, unfortunately, this was quite otherwise: each separate
contingent had its own commander, but we hear of no joint commander
at all. Nor were the chiefs who came from the larger cities—Milesian,
Chian, Samian, or Lesbian—men like Themistoklês, competent and
willing to stand forward as self-created leaders, and to usurp for
the moment, with the general consent and for the general benefit, a
privilege not intended for them. The only man of sufficient energy
and forwardness to do this, was the Phôkæan Dionysius,—unfortunately,
the captain of the smallest contingent of the fleet, and therefore
enjoying the least respect. For Phôkæa, once the daring explorer of
the western waters, had so dwindled down since the Persian conquest
of Ionia, that she could now furnish no more than three ships;
and her ancient maritime spirit survived only in the bosom of her
captain. When Dionysius saw the Ionians assembled at Ladê, willing,
eager, full of talk and mutual encouragement, but untrained and
taking no thought of discipline, or nautical practice, or coöperation
in the hour of battle,—he saw the risk which they ran for want of
these precautions, and strenuously remonstrated with them: “Our fate
hangs on the razor’s edge, men of Ionia: either to be freemen or
slaves,—and slaves too, caught after running away. Set yourself at
once to work and duty,—you will then have trouble indeed at first,
with certain victory and freedom afterwards. But if you persist
in this carelessness and disorder, there is no hope for you to
escape the king’s revenge for your revolt. Be persuaded and commit
yourself to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">[p. 302]</span> me;
and I pledge myself, if the gods only hold an equal balance, that
your enemies either will not fight, or will be severely beaten.”<a
id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a></p>

<p>The wisdom of this advice was so apparent, that the Ionians,
quitting their comfortable tents on the shore of Ladê and going on
board their ships, submitted themselves to the continuous nautical
labors and manœuvres imposed upon them by Dionysius. The rowers, and
the hoplites on the deck, were exercised in their separate functions,
and even when they were not so employed, the ships were kept at
anchor, and the crews on board, instead of on shore; so that the work
lasted all day long, under a hot summer’s sun. Such labor, new to
the Ionian crews, was endured for seven successive days, after which
they broke out with one accord into resolute mutiny and refusal:
“Which of the gods have we offended, to bring upon ourselves such
a retribution as this? madmen as we are, to put ourselves into the
hands of this Phôkæan braggart, who has furnished only three ships!<a
id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a>
He has now got us, and is ruining us without remedy: many of us are
already sick, many others are sickening; we had better make up our
minds to Persian slavery, or any other mischiefs, rather than go on
with these present sufferings. Come, we will not obey this man any
longer.” And they forthwith refused to execute his orders, resuming
their tents on shore, with the enjoyments of shade, rest, and
inactive talk, as before.</p>

<p>I have not chosen to divest this instructive scene of the
dramatic liveliness with which it is given in Herodotus,—the
more so as it has all the air of reality, and as Hekatæus, the
historian, was probably present in the island of Ladê, and may
have described what he actually saw and heard. When we see the
in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[p. 303]</span>tolerable
hardship which these nautical manœuvres and labors imposed upon the
Ionians, though men not unaccustomed to ordinary ship-work,—and
when we witness their perfect incapacity to submit themselves to
such a discipline, even with extreme danger staring them in the
face,—we shall be able to appreciate the severe and unremitting toil
whereby the Athenian seaman afterwards purchased that perfection
of nautical discipline which characterized him at the beginning
of the Peloponnesian war. It will appear, as we proceed with this
history, that the full development of the Athenian democracy worked
a revolution in Grecian military marine, chiefly by enforcing upon
the citizen seaman a strict continuous training, such as was only
surpassed by the Lacedæmonian drill on land,—and by thus rendering
practicable a species of nautical manœuvring which was unknown even
at the time of the battle of Salamis. I shall show this more fully
hereafter: at present, I contrast it briefly with the incapacity of
the Ionians at Ladê, in order that it may be understood how painful
such training really was. The reader of Grecian history is usually
taught to associate only ideas of turbulence and anarchy with the
Athenian democracy; but the Athenian navy, the child and champion
of that democracy, will be found to display an indefatigable labor
and obedience nowhere else witnessed in Greece, and of which even
the first lessons, as in the case now before us, prove to others so
irksome as to outweigh the prospect of extreme and imminent peril.
The same impatience of steady toil and discipline, which the Ionians
displayed to their own ruin before the battle of Ladê, will be found
to characterize them fifty years afterwards as allies of Athens, as
I shall have occasion to show when I come to describe the Athenian
empire.</p>

<p>Ending in this abrupt and mutinous manner, the judicious
suggestions of the Phôkæan leader did more harm than good. Perhaps
his manner of dealing may have been unadvisedly rude, but we are
surprised to see that no one among the leaders of the larger
contingents had the good sense to avail himself of the first
readiness of the Ionians, and to employ his superior influence in
securing the continuance of a good practice once begun. Not one such
superior man did this Ionic revolt throw up. From the day on which
the Ionians discarded Dionysius, their camp be<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_304">[p. 304]</span>came a scene of disunion and mistrust.
Some of them grew so reckless and unmanageable, that the better
portion despaired of maintaining any orderly battle; and the Samians
in particular now repented that they had declined the secret
offers made to them by their expelled despot,<a id="FNanchor_567"
href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a>—Æakês, son of
Sylosôn. They sent privately to renew the negotiation, received
a fresh promise of the same indulgence, and agreed to desert
when the occasion arrived. On the day of battle, when the two
fleets were on the point of coming to action, the sixty Samian
ships all sailed off, except eleven, whose captains disdained
such treachery. Other Ionians followed their example; yet amidst
the reciprocal crimination which Herodotus had heard, he finds
it difficult to determine who was most to blame, though he names
the Lesbians as among the earliest deserters.<a id="FNanchor_568"
href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> The hundred ships
from Chios, constituting the centre of the fleet—each ship carrying
forty chosen soldiers fully armed—formed a brilliant exception to
the rest; they fought with the greatest fidelity and resolution,
inflicting upon the enemy, and themselves sustaining, heavy loss.
Dionysius, the Phôkæan, also behaved in a manner worthy of his
previous language,—capturing with his three ships the like number
of Phenicians. But these examples of bravery did not compensate the
treachery or cowardice of the rest, and the defeat of the Ionians at
Ladê was complete as well as irrecoverable. To the faithful Chians,
the loss was terrible, both in the battle and after it. For though
some of their vessels escaped from the defeat safely to Chios,
others were so damaged as to be obliged to run ashore close at hand
on the promontory of Mykalê, where the crews quitted them, with the
intention of marching northward, through the Ephesian territory, to
the continent opposite their own island. We hear with astonishment
that, at that critical moment, the Ephesian women were engaged in
solemnizing the Thesmophoria,—a festival celebrated at night, in the
open air, in some uninhabited portion of the territory, and without
the presence of any male person. As the Chian fugitives entered
the Ephesian territory by night, their coming being neither known
nor anticipated,—it was believed that they were thieves or pirates
coming to seize the women, and under this<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_305">[p. 305]</span> error they were attacked by the
Ephesians and slain.<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569"
class="fnanchor">[569]</a> It would seem from this incident that
the Ephesians had taken no part in the Ionic revolt, nor are
they mentioned amidst the various contingents. Nor is anything
said either of Kolophon, or Lebedus, or Eræ.<a id="FNanchor_570"
href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a></p>

<p>The Phôkæan Dionysius, perceiving that the defeat of Ladê was the
ruin of the Ionic cause, and that his native city was again doomed
to Persian subjection, did not think it prudent even to return home.
Immediately after the battle he set sail, not for Phôkæa, but for the
Phenician coast, at this moment stripped of its protecting cruisers.
He seized several Phenician merchantmen, out of which considerable
profit was obtained: then setting sail for Sicily, he undertook the
occupation of a privateer against the Carthaginians and Tyrrhenians,
abstaining from injury towards Greeks.<a id="FNanchor_571"
href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> Such an employment
seems then to have been perfectly admissible. A considerable body of
Samians also migrated to Sicily, indignant at the treachery of their
admirals in the battle, and yet more indignant at the approaching
restoration of their despot Æakês. How these Samian emigrants became
established in the Sicilian town of Zanklê,<a id="FNanchor_572"
href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> I shall mention as a
part of the course of Sicilian events, which will come hereafter.</p>

<p>The victory of Ladê enabled the Persians to attack Milêtus by
sea as well as by land; they prosecuted the siege with the utmost
vigor, by undermining the walls, and by various engines of attack:
in which department their resources seem to have been enlarged since
the days of Harpagus. In no long time the city was taken by storm,
and miserable was the fate reserved to it. The adult male population
was chiefly slain; while such of them as were preserved, together
with the women and children, were sent in a body to Susa, to await
the orders of Darius,—who assigned to them a residence at Ampê, not
far from the mouth of the Tigris. The temple at Branchidæ was burned
and pillaged, as Hekatæus had predicted at the beginning of the
revolt: the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[p. 306]</span> large
treasures therein contained must have gone far to defray the costs
of the Persian army. The Milesian territory is said to have been
altogether denuded of its former inhabitants,—the Persians retaining
for themselves the city with the plain adjoining to it, and making
over the mountainous portions to the Karians of Pedasa. Some few of
the Milesians found a place among the Samian emigrants to Sicily.<a
id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a>
It is certain, however, that new Grecian inhabitants must have been
subsequently admitted into Milêtus; for it appears ever afterwards as
a Grecian town, though with diminished power and importance.</p>

<p>The capture of Milêtus, in the sixth year from the commencement
of the revolt,<a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574"
class="fnanchor">[574]</a> carried with it the rapid submission
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[p. 307]</span> the
neighboring towns in Karia.<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575"
class="fnanchor">[575]</a> During the next summer,—the Phenician
fleet having wintered at Milêtus,—the Persian forces by sea
and land reconquered all the Asiatic Greeks, insular as well
as continental. Chios, Lesbos, and Tenedos,—the towns in the
Chersonese,—Selymbria and Perinthus in Thrace,—Prokonnêsus and
Artakê in the Propontis,—all these towns were taken or sacked by the
Persian and Phenician fleet.<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576"
class="fnanchor">[576]</a> The inhabitants of Byzantium and Chalkêdôn
fled for the most part, without even awaiting its arrival, to
Mesembria, and the Athenian Miltiadês only escaped Persian captivity
by a rapid flight from his abode in the Chersonese to Athens. His
pursuers were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[p. 308]</span>
indeed so close upon him, that one of his ships, with his son
Metiochus on board, fell into their hands. As Miltiadês had been
strenuous in urging the destruction of the bridge over the Danube,
on the occasion of the Scythian expedition, the Phenicians were
particularly anxious to get possession of his person, as the most
acceptable of all Greek prisoners to the Persian king; who, however,
when Metiochus the son of Miltiadês was brought to Susa, not only
did him no harm, but treated him with great kindness, and gave him
a Persian wife with a comfortable maintenance.<a id="FNanchor_577"
href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a></p>

<p>Far otherwise did the Persian generals deal with the reconquered
cities on and near the coast. The threats which had been held out
before the battle of Ladê were realized to the full. The most
beautiful Greek youths and virgins were picked out, to be distributed
among the Persian grandees as eunuchs, or inmates of the harems; the
cities with their edifices, sacred as well as profane, were made
a prey to the flames; and in the case of the islands, Herodotus
even tells us, that a line of Persians was formed from shore to
shore, which swept each territory from north to south, and drove
the inhabitants out of it.<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578"
class="fnanchor">[578]</a> That much of this hard treatment is well
founded, there can be no doubt. But it must be exaggerated as to
extent of depopulation and destruction, for these islands and cities
appear ever afterwards as occupied by a Grecian population, and
even as in a tolerable, though reduced, condition. Samos was made
an exception to the rest, and completely spared by the Persians,
as a reward to its captains for setting the example of desertion
at the battle of Ladê; at the same time, Æakês the despot of that
island was reinstated in his government.<a id="FNanchor_579"
href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> It appears that
several other despots were also replaced in their respective cities,
though we are not told which.</p>

<p>Amidst the sufferings endured by so many innocent persons, of
every age and of both sexes, the fate of Histiæus excites but
little sympathy. Having learned, while carrying on his piracies at
Byzantium, the surrender of Milêtus, he thought it expedient to
sail with his Lesbian vessels to Chios, where admittance was<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_309">[p. 309]</span> refused to him. But the
Chians, weakened as they had been by the late battle, were in little
condition to resist, so that he defeated their troops and despoiled
the island. During the present break-up of the Asiatic Greeks, there
were doubtless many who, like the Phôkæan Dionysius, did not choose
to return home to an enslaved city, yet had no fixed plan for a
new abode: of these exiles, a considerable number put themselves
under the temporary command of Histiæus, and accompanied him to
the plunder of Thasos.<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580"
class="fnanchor">[580]</a> While besieging that town, he learned
the news that the Phenician fleet had quitted Milêtus to attack the
remaining Ionic towns; and he left his designs on Thasos unfinished,
in order to go and defend Lesbos. But in this latter island the
dearth of provisions was such, that he was forced to cross over to
the continent to reap the standing corn around Atarneus and in the
fertile plain of Mysia near the river Kaïkus. Here he fell in with a
considerable Persian force under Harpagus,—was beaten, compelled to
flee, and taken prisoner. On his being carried to Sardis, Artaphernês
the satrap caused him to be at once crucified: partly, no doubt, from
genuine hatred, but partly also under the persuasion that, if he were
sent up as a prisoner to Susa, he might again become dangerous,—since
Darius would even now spare his life, under an indelible sentiment of
gratitude for the maintenance of the bridge over the Danube. The head
of Histiæus was embalmed and sent up to Susa, where Darius caused
it to be honorably buried, condemning this precipitate execution
of a man who had once been his preserver.<a id="FNanchor_581"
href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a></p>

<p>We need not wonder that the capture of Milêtus excited the
strongest feeling, of mixed sympathy and consternation, among
the Athenians. In the succeeding year (so at least we are led to
think, though the date cannot be positively determined), it was
selected as the subject of a tragedy,—The Capture of Milêtus,—by the
dramatic poet Phrynichus; which, when performed, so painfully wrung
the feelings of the Athenian audience, that they burst into tears
in the theatre, and the poet was condemned to pay a fine of one
thousand drachmæ, as “having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[p.
310]</span> recalled to them their own misfortunes.”<a
id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a>
The piece was forbidden to be afterwards acted, and has not come
down to us. Some critics have supposed that Herodotus has not
correctly assigned the real motive which determined the Athenians
to impose this fine.<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583"
class="fnanchor">[583]</a> For it is certain that the subjects
usually selected for tragedy were portions of heroic legend, and not
matters of recent history; so that the Athenians might complain of
Phrynichus on the double ground,—for having violated an established
canon of propriety, as well as for touching their sensibilities too
deeply. Still, I see no reason for doubting that the cause assigned
by Herodotus is substantially the true one; but it is very possible
that Phrynichus, at an age when tragic poetry had not yet reached its
full development, might touch this very tender subject with a rough
and offensive hand, before a people who had fair reason to dread
the like cruel fate for themselves. Æschylus, in his Persæ, would
naturally carry with him the full tide of Athenian sympathy, while
dwelling on the victories of Salamis and Platæa. But to interest the
audience in Persian success and Grecian suffering, was a task in
which much greater poets than Phrynichus would have failed,—and which
no judicious poet would have undertaken. The sack of Magdeburg, by
Count Tilly, in the Thirty Years’ war, was not likely to be endured
as the subject of dramatic representation in any Protestant town of
Germany.</p>

  <h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXVI.<br />
    FROM THE IONIC REVOLT TO THE BATTLE OF MARATHON.</h2>
</div>

<p class="mt1"><span class="smcap">In the</span> preceding chapter,
I indicated the point of confluence between the European and Asiatic
streams of Grecian history,—the commencement of a decided Persian
intention to conquer Attica; manifested first in the form of a
threat by Artaphernês the satrap, when he enjoined the Athenians to
take back Hippias as the only condition of safety, and afterwards
converted into a passion in the bosom of Darius in consequence of the
burning of Sardis. From this time forward, therefore, the affairs
of Greece and Persia came to be in direct relation one with the
other, and capable of being embodied, much more than before, into one
continuous narrative.</p>

<p>The reconquest of Ionia being thoroughly completed, Artaphernês
proceeded to organize the future government of it, with a degree of
prudence and forethought not often visible in Persian proceedings.
Convoking deputies from all the different cities, he compelled
them to enter into a permanent convention, for the amicable
settlement of disputes, so as to prevent all employment of force
by any one against the others. Moreover, he caused the territory
of each city to be measured by parasangs (each parasang was equal
to thirty stadia, or about three miles and a half), and arranged
the assessments of tribute according to this measurement, without
any material departure, however, from the sums which had been
paid before the revolt.<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584"
class="fnanchor">[584]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, Herodotus is unusually brief in his allusion to
this proceeding, which it would have been highly interesting to be
able to comprehend perfectly. We may, however, assume it as certain,
that both the population and the territory of many among the Ionic
cities, if not of all, were materially altered in consequence of
the preceding revolt, and still more in conse<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_312">[p. 312]</span>quence of the cruelties with which the
suppression of the revolt had been accompanied. In regard to Milêtus,
Herodotus tells us that the Persians retained for themselves the
city with its circumjacent plain, but gave the mountain portion of
the Milesian territory to the Karians of Pêdasa.<a id="FNanchor_585"
href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> Such a proceeding
would naturally call for a fresh measurement and assessment of
tribute; and there may have been similar transfers of land elsewhere.
I have already observed that the statements which we find in
Herodotus, of utter depopulation and destruction falling upon the
cities, cannot be credited in their full extent; for these cities
are all peopled, and all Hellenic, afterwards. But there can be no
doubt that they are partially true, and that the miseries of those
days, as stated in the work of Hekatæus, as well as by contemporary
informants with whom Herodotus had probably conversed, must have
been extreme. New inhabitants would probably be admitted in many of
them, to supply the loss sustained; and such infusion of fresh blood
would strengthen the necessity for the organization introduced by
Artaphernês, in order to determine clearly the obligations due from
the cities both to the Persian government and towards each other.
Herodotus considers that the arrangement was extremely beneficial to
the Ionians, and so it must unquestionably have appeared, coming as
it did immediately after so much previous suffering. He farther adds,
that the tribute then fixed remained unaltered until his own day,—a
statement requiring some comment, which I reserve until the time
arrives for describing the condition of the Asiatic Greeks after the
repulse of Xerxês from Greece proper.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the intentions of Darius for the conquest of Greece
were now effectively manifested: Mardonius, invested with the
supreme command, and at the head of a large force, was sent down
in the ensuing spring for the purpose. Having reached Kilikia in
the course of the march, he himself got on ship-board and went
by sea to Ionia, while his army marched across Asia Minor to the
Hellespont. His proceeding in Ionia surprises us, and seems to have
appeared surprising as well to Herodotus himself as to his readers.
Mardonius deposed the despots throughout the various Greek cities,<a
id="FNanchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a>
and left the people of each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[p.
313]</span> to govern themselves, subject to the Persian dominion
and tribute. This was a complete reversal of the former policy of
Persia, and must be ascribed to a new conviction, doubtless wise and
well founded, which had recently grown up among the Persian leaders,
that on the whole their unpopularity was aggravated, more than their
strength was increased, by employing these despots as instruments.
The phenomena of the late Ionic revolt were well calculated to teach
such a lesson; but we shall not often find the Persians profiting by
experience, throughout the course of this history.</p>

<p>Mardonius did not remain long in Ionia, but passed on with his
fleet to the Hellespont, where the land-force had already arrived.
He transported it across into Europe, and began his march through
Thrace; all of which had already been reduced by Megabazus, and
does not seem to have participated in the Ionic revolt. The island
of Thasus surrendered to the fleet without any resistance, and the
land-force was conveyed across the Strymon to the Greek city of
Akanthus, on the western coast of the Strymonic gulf. From hence
his land-force marched into Macedonia, and subdued a considerable
portion of its inhabitants, perhaps some of those not comprised in
the dominion of Amyntas, since that prince had before submitted to
Megabazus. Meanwhile, he sent his fleet to double the promontory
of Mount Athos, and to join the land-force again at the gulf of
Therma, with a view of conquering as much of Greece as he could,
and even of prosecuting the march as far as Athens and Eretria;<a
id="FNanchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> so
that the expedition afterwards accomplished by Xerxês would<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_314">[p. 314]</span> have been tried at
least by Mardonius, twelve or thirteen years earlier, had not a
terrible storm completely disabled the fleet. The sea near Athos was
then, and is now, full of peril to navigators. One of the hurricanes,
so frequent in its neighborhood, overtook the Persian fleet,
destroyed three hundred ships, and drowned or cast ashore not less
than twenty thousand men: of those who reached the shore, many died
of cold, or were devoured by the wild beasts on that inhospitable
tongue of land. This disaster checked altogether the farther
progress of Mardonius, who also sustained considerable loss with his
land-army, and was himself wounded, in a night attack made upon him
by the tribe of Thracians called Brygi. Though strong enough to repel
and avenge this attack, and to subdue the Brygi, he was yet in no
condition to advance farther. Both the land-force and the fleet were
conveyed back to the Hellespont, and from thence across to Asia, with
all the shame of failure. Nor was Mardonius again employed by Darius,
though we cannot make out that the fault was imputable to him.<a
id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a> We
shall hear of him again under Xerxês.</p>

<p>The ill-success of Mardonius seems to have inspired the Thasians,
so recently subdued, with the idea of revolting. At least, they
provoked the suspicion of Darius by making active preparations for
defence, building war-ships, and strengthening their fortifications.
The Thasians were at this time in great opulence, chiefly from their
gold and silver mines, both in their island and in their mainland
territory opposite. Their mines at Skaptê Hylê, in Thrace, yielded
to them an annual income of eighty talents; and altogether their
surplus revenue—after defraying all the expenses of government, so
that the inhabitants were entirely untaxed—was two hundred talents
(forty-six thousand pounds, if Attic talents; more, if either
Euboic or Æginæan). With these large means, they were enabled soon
to make preparations which excited notice among their neighbors,
many of whom were doubtless jealous of their prosperity, and
perhaps inclined to dispute with them possession of the profitable
mines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[p. 315]</span> of Skaptê
Hylê. As in other cases, so in this: the jealousies among subject
neighbors often procured revelations to the superior power: the
proceedings of the Thasians were made known, and they were forced to
raze their fortifications as well as to surrender all their ships
to the Persians at Abdêra.<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589"
class="fnanchor">[589]</a></p>

<p>Though dissatisfied with Mardonius, Darius was only the more
eagerly bent on his project of conquering Greece, and Hippias
was at his side to keep alive his wrath against the Athenians.<a
id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a>
Orders were despatched to the maritime cities of his empire to
equip both ships of war and horse-transports for a renewed attempt.
His intentions were probably known in Greece itself by this time,
from the recent march of his army to Macedonia; but he thought it
advisable to send heralds round to most of the Grecian cities, in
order to require from each the formal token of submission,—earth and
water; and thus to ascertain what extent of resistance his intended
expedition was likely to experience. The answers received were to
a high degree favorable. Many of the continental Greeks sent their
submission, as well as all those islanders to whom application was
made. Among the former, we are probably to reckon the Thebans and
Thessalians, though Herodotus does not particularize them. Among
the latter, Naxos, Eubœa, and some of the smaller islands, are not
included; but Ægina, at that time the first maritime power of Greece,
is expressly included.<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591"
class="fnanchor">[591]</a></p>

<p>Nothing marks so clearly the imminent peril in which the liberties
of Greece were now placed, and the terror inspired by the Persians
after their reconquest of Ionia, as this abasement on the part of
the Æginetans, whose commerce with the Asiatic islands and continent
doubtless impressed them strongly with the melancholy consequences
of unsuccessful resistance to the Great King. But on the present
occasion, their conduct was dictated as much by antipathy to Athens
as by fear, so that Greece was thus threatened with the intrusion
of the Persian arm as ally and arbiter in her internal contests: a
contingency which, if it had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[p.
316]</span> occurred now in the dispute between Ægina and Athens,
would have led to the certain enslavement of Greece,—though when
it did occur nearly a century afterwards, towards the close of the
Peloponnesian war, and in consequence of the prolonged struggle
between Lacedæmon and Athens, Greece had become strong enough in her
own force to endure it without the loss of substantial independence.
The war between Thebes and Ægina on one side, and Athens on the
other,—begun several years before, and growing out of the connection
between Athens and Platæa,—had never yet been terminated. The
Æginetans had taken part in that war from gratuitous feeling, either
of friendship for Thebes, or of enmity to Athens, without any
direct ground of quarrel,<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592"
class="fnanchor">[592]</a> and they had begun the war even without
the formality of notice. Though a period apparently not less than
fourteen years (from about 506-492 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>) had elapsed
since it began, the state of hostility still continued; and we may
well conceive that Hippias, the great instigator of Persian attack
upon Greece, would not fail to enforce upon all the enemies of Athens
the prudence of seconding, or at least of not opposing, the efforts
of the Persian to reinstate him in that city. It was partly under
this feeling, combined with genuine alarm, that both Thebes and Ægina
manifested submissive dispositions towards the heralds of Darius.</p>

<p>Among these heralds, some had gone both to Athens and to
Sparta, for the same purpose of demanding earth and water. The
reception given to them at both places was angry in the extreme.
The Athenians cast the herald into the pit called the barathrum,<a
id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a>
into which they sometimes precipitated public crimi<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[p. 317]</span>nals: the Spartans threw
the herald who came to them into a well, desiring the unfortunate
messenger to take earth and water from thence to the king. The
inviolability of heralds was so ancient and undisputed in Greece,
from the Homeric times downward, that nothing short of the fiercest
excitement could have instigated any Grecian community to such
an outrage. But to the Lacedæmonians, now accustomed to regard
themselves as the first of all Grecian states, and to be addressed
always in the character of superiors, the demand appeared so gross an
insult as to banish from their minds for the time all recollection of
established obligations. They came subsequently, however, to repent
of the act as highly criminal, and to look upon it as the cause of
misfortunes which overtook them thirty or forty years afterwards: how
they tried at that time to expiate it, I shall hereafter recount.<a
id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a></p>

<p>But if, on the one hand, the wounded dignity of the Spartans
hurried them into the commission of this wrong, it was on the other
hand of signal use to the general liberties of Greece, by rousing
them out of their apathy as to the coming invader, and placing
them with regard to him in the same state of inexpiable<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[p. 318]</span> hostility as Athens
and Eretria. We see at once the bonds drawn closer between Athens
and Sparta. The Athenians, for the first time, prefer a complaint
at Sparta against the Æginetans for having given earth and water
to Darius,—accusing them of having done this with views of enmity
to Athens, and in order to invade Attica conjointly with the
Persian. This they represented “as treason to Hellas,” calling
upon Sparta as head of Greece to interfere. And in consequence
of their appeal, Kleomenês king of Sparta went over to Ægina, to
take measures against the authors of the late proceeding, “for the
general benefit of Hellas.”<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595"
class="fnanchor">[595]</a></p>

<p>The proceeding now before us is of very great importance in the
progress of Grecian history. It is the first direct and positive
historical manifestation of Hellas as an aggregate body, with Sparta
as its chief, and obligations of a certain sort on the part of its
members, the neglect or violation of which constitutes a species
of treason. I have already pointed out several earlier incidents,
showing how the Greek political mind, beginning from entire severance
of states, became gradually prepared for this idea of a permanent
league with mutual obligations and power of enforcement vested in
a permanent chief,—an idea never fully carried into practice, but
now distinctly manifest and partially operative. First, the great
acquired power and territory of Sparta, her military training, her
undisturbed political traditions, create an unconscious deference
towards her, such as was not felt towards any other state: next,
she is seen in the proceedings against Athens, after the expulsion
of Hippias, as summoning and conducting to war a cluster of
self-obliged Peloponnesian allies, with certain formalities which
gave to the alliance an imposing permanence and solemnity: thirdly,
her position becomes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[p.
319]</span> recognized as first power or president of Greece, both
by foreigners who invite alliance (Crœsus), or by Greeks who seek
help, such as the Platæans against Thebes, or the Ionians against
Persia. But Sparta has not been hitherto found willing to take
on herself the performance of this duty of protector-general.
She refused the Ionians and the Samian Mæandrius, as well as the
Platæans, in spite of their entreaties founded on common Hellenic
lineage: the expedition which she undertook against Polykratês of
Samos, was founded upon private motives of displeasure, even in the
estimation of the Lacedæmonians themselves: moreover, even if all
these requests had been granted, she might have seemed to be rather
obeying a generous sympathy than performing a duty incumbent upon
her as superior. But in the case now before us, of Athens against
Ægina, the latter consideration stands distinctly prominent. Athens
is not a member of the cluster of Spartan allies, nor does she claim
the compassion of Sparta, as defenceless against an overpowering
Grecian neighbor. She complains of a Pan-Hellenic obligation as
having been contravened by the Æginetans to her detriment and danger,
and calls upon Sparta to enforce upon the delinquents respect to
these obligations. For the first time in Grecian history, such a call
is made; for the first time in Grecian history, it is effectively
answered. We may reasonably doubt, whether it would have been thus
answered,—considering the tardy, unimpressible, and home-keeping
character of the Spartans, with their general insensibility
to distant dangers,<a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596"
class="fnanchor">[596]</a>—if the adventure of the Persian herald had
not occurred to gall their pride beyond endurance; to drive them into
unpardonable hostility with the Great King; and to cast them into the
same boat with Athens for keeping off an enemy who threatened the
common liberties of Hellas.</p>

<p>From this time, then, we may consider that there exists a
recognized political union of Greece against the Persians,<a
id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a>—or
at least something as near to a political union as Grecian temper
will permit,—with Sparta as its head for the present. To such a
preëminence of Sparta, Grecian history had been gradually<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[p. 320]</span> tending; but the final
event which placed it beyond dispute, and which humbled for the time
her ancient and only rival—Argos—is now to be noticed.</p>

<p>It was about three or four years before the arrival of these
Persian heralds in Greece, and nearly at the time when Milêtus was
besieged by the Persian generals, that a war broke out between
Sparta and Argos,<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598"
class="fnanchor">[598]</a>—on what grounds Herodotus does not inform
us. Kleomenês, encouraged by a promise of the oracle that he should
take Argos, led the Lacedæmonian troops to the banks of the Erasinus,
the border river of the Argeian territory. But the sacrifices,
without which no river could be crossed, were so unfavorable, that he
altered his course, extorted some vessels from Ægina and Sikyon,<a
id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> and
carried his troops by sea to Nauplia, the seaport belonging to Argos,
and to the territory of Tiryns. The Argeians having marched their
forces down to resist him, the two armies joined battle at Sêpeia,
near Tiryns: Kleomenês, by a piece of simplicity on the part of his
enemies, which we find it difficult to credit in Herodotus, was
enabled to attack them unprepared, and obtained a decisive victory.
For the Argeians, it is stated, were so afraid of being overreached
by stratagem, in the post which their army occupied over against the
enemy, that they listened for the commands proclaimed aloud by the
Lacedæmonian herald, and performed with their own army the same order
which they thus heard given.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[p.
321]</span> This came to the knowledge of Kleomenês, who communicated
private notice to his soldiers, that when the herald proclaimed
orders to go to dinner, they should not obey, but immediately
stand to their arms. We are to presume that the Argeian camp was
sufficiently near to that of the Lacedæmonians to enable them to
hear the voice of the herald, yet not within sight, from the nature
of the ground. Accordingly, so soon as the Argeians heard the
herald in the enemy’s camp proclaim the word to go to dinner,<a
id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a>
they went to dinner themselves; and in this disorderly condition they
were easily overthrown by the Spartans. Many of them perished in the
field, while the fugitives took refuge in a thick grove consecrated
to their eponymous hero Argus. Kleomenês pursued and inclosed them
therein; but thinking it safer to employ deceit rather than force,
he ascertained from deserters the names of the chief Argeians thus
shut up, and then invited them out successively by means of a
herald,—pretending that he had received their ransom, and that they
were released. As fast as each man came out, he was put to death; the
fate of these unhappy sufferers being concealed from their comrades
within the grove by the thickness of the foliage, until some one
climbing to the top of a tree detected and proclaimed the destruction
going on,—after about fifty of the victims had perished. Unable to
entice any more of the Argeians from their consecrated refuge, which
they still vainly hoped would protect them, Kleomenês set fire to the
grove, and burnt it to the ground, insomuch that the persons within
it appear to have been destroyed, either by fire or by sword.<a
id="FNanchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a>
After the conflagration had begun, he inquired for the first time
to whom the grove belonged, and learnt that it belonged to the hero
Argus.</p>

<p>Not less than six thousand citizens, the flower and strength
of Argos, perished in this disastrous battle and retreat. And so
completely was the city prostrated, that Kleomenês might easily
have taken it, had he chosen to march thither forthwith and attack
it with vigor. If we are to believe later historians whom<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_322">[p. 322]</span> Pausanias, Polyænus,
and Plutarch have copied, he did march thither and attack it,
but was repulsed by the valor of the Argeian women; who, in the
dearth of warriors occasioned by the recent defeat, took arms along
with the slaves, headed by the poetess Telesilla, and gallantly
defended the walls.<a id="FNanchor_602" href="#Footnote_602"
class="fnanchor">[602]</a> This is probably a mythe, generated by
a desire to embody in detail the dictum of the oracle a little
before, about “the female conquering the male.”<a id="FNanchor_603"
href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> Without meaning to
deny that the Argeian women might have been capable of achieving so
patriotic a deed, if Kleomenês had actually marched to the attack
of their city, we are compelled, by the distinct statement of
Herodotus, to affirm that he never did attack it. Immediately after
the burning of the sacred grove of Argos, he dismissed the bulk of
his army to Sparta, retaining only one thousand choice troops,—with
whom he marched up to the Hêræum, or great temple of Hêrê, between
Argos and Mykênæ, to offer sacrifice. The priest in attendance
forbade him to enter, saying that no stranger was allowed to offer
sacrifice in the temple. But Kleomenês had once already forced his
way into the sanctuary of Athênê, on the Athenian acropolis, in
spite of the priestess and her interdict,—and he now acted still
more brutally towards the Argeian priest, for he directed his helots
to drag him from the altar and scourge him.<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_323">[p. 323]</span> Having offered sacrifice, Kleomenês
returned with his remaining force to Sparta.<a id="FNanchor_604"
href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a></p>

<p>But the army whom he had sent home returned with a full persuasion
that Argos might easily have been taken,—that the king alone was
to blame for having missed the opportunity. As soon as he himself
returned, his enemies—perhaps his colleague Demaratus—brought him
to trial before the ephors, on a charge of having been bribed,
against which he defended himself as follows: He had invaded the
hostile territory on the faith of an assurance from the oracle that
he should take Argos; but so soon as he had burnt down the sacred
grove of the hero Argus,—without knowing to whom it belonged,—he
became at once sensible that this was all that the god meant by
<i>taking Argos</i>, and therefore that the divine promise had been
fully realized. Accordingly, he did not think himself at liberty
to commence any fresh attack, until he had ascertained whether the
gods would approve it and would grant him success. It was with this
view that he sacrificed in the Hêræum. But though his sacrifice
was favorable, he observed that the flame kindled on the altar
flashed back from the bosom of the statue of Hêrê, and not from her
head. If the flame had flashed from her head, he would have known
at once that the gods intended him to take the city by storm;<a
id="FNanchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a>
but the flash from her bosom plainly indicated that the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[p. 324]</span> topmost success was
out of his reach, and that he had already reaped all the glories
which they intended for him. We may see that Herodotus, though
he refrains from criticizing this story, suspects it to be a
fabrication. Not so the Spartan ephors: to them it appeared not less
true as a story than triumphant as a defence, insuring to Kleomenês
an honorable acquittal.<a id="FNanchor_606" href="#Footnote_606"
class="fnanchor">[606]</a></p>

<p>Though this Spartan king lost the opportunity of taking Argos,
his victories already gained had inflicted upon her a blow such as
she did not recover for a generation, and put her for a time out of
all condition to dispute the primacy of Greece with Lacedæmon. I
have already mentioned that both in legend and in earliest history,
Argos stands forth as the first power in Greece, with legendary
claims to headship, and decidedly above Lacedæmon; who gradually
usurps from her, first the reality of superior power, next the
recognition of preëminence,—and is now, at the period which we have
reached, taking upon herself both the rights and the duties of a
presiding state over a body of allies who are bound both to her and
to each other. Her title to this honor, however, was never admitted
at Argos, and it is very probable that the war just described grew
in some way or other out of the increasing presidential power which
circumstances were tending to throw into her hands. And the complete
temporary prostration of Argos was an essential condition to the
quiet acquisition of this power by Sparta. Occurring as it did two or
three years before the above-recounted adventure of the heralds, it
removed the only rival at that time both willing and able to compete
with Sparta,—a rival who might well have prevented any effective
union under another chief, though she could no longer have secured
any Pan-Hellenic ascendency for herself,—a rival who would have
seconded Ægina in her submission to the Persians, and would thus have
lamed incurably the defen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[p.
325]</span>sive force of Greece. The ships which Kleomenês had
obtained from the Æginetans as well as from the Sikyonians, against
their own will, for landing his troops at Nauplia, brought upon both
these cities the enmity of Argos, which the Sikyonians compromised
by paying a sum of money, while the Æginetans refused to do so.<a
id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a>
And thus the circumstances of the Kleomenic war had the effect not
only of enfeebling Argos, but of alienating her from natural allies
and supporters, and clearing the ground for undisputed Spartan
primacy.</p>

<p>Returning now to the complaint preferred by Athens to the Spartans
against the traitorous submission of Ægina to Darius, we find that
king Kleomenês passed immediately over to that island for the purpose
of inquiry and punishment. He was proceeding to seize and carry away
as prisoners several of the leading Æginetans, when Krius and some
others among them opposed to him a menacing resistance, telling him
that he came without any regular warrant from Sparta and under the
influence of Athenian bribes,—that, in order to carry authority, both
the Spartan kings ought to come together. It was not of their own
accord that the Æginetans ventured to adopt so dangerous a course.
Demaratus, the colleague of Kleomenês in the junior or Prokleid
line of kings, had suggested to them the step and promised to carry
them through it safely.<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608"
class="fnanchor">[608]</a> Dissension between the two coördinate
kings was no new phenomenon at Sparta; but in the case of Demaratus
and Kleomenês, it had broken out some years previously on the
occasion of the march against Attica; and Demaratus, hating his
colleague more than ever, entered into the present intrigue
with the Æginetans with the deliberate purpose of frustrating
his intervention. He succeeded, and Kleomenês was compelled to
return to Sparta; not without unequivocal menace against Krius
and the other Æginetans who had repelled him,<a id="FNanchor_609"
href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> and not without a
thorough determination to depose Demaratus.</p>

<p>It appears that suspicions had always attached to the legiti<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[p. 326]</span>macy of Demaratus’s
birth. His reputed father Aristo had had no offspring by two
successive wives: at last, he became enamored of the wife of his
friend Agêtus,—a woman of surpassing beauty,—and entrapped him into
an agreement, whereby each solemnly bound himself to surrender
anything belonging to him which the other might ask for. That which
Agêtus asked from Aristo was at once given: in return, the latter
demanded to have the wife of Agêtus, who was thunderstruck at the
request, and indignantly complained of having been cheated into a
sacrifice of all others the most painful: nevertheless, the oath was
peremptory, and he was forced to comply. The birth of Demaratus took
place so soon after this change of husbands, that when it was first
made known to Aristo, as he sat upon a bench along with the ephors,
he counted on his fingers the number of months since his marriage,
and exclaimed with an oath, “The child cannot be mine.” He soon,
however, retracted his opinion, and acknowledged the child, who grew
up without any question being publicly raised as to his birth, and
succeeded his father on the throne. But the original words of Aristo
had never been forgotten, and private suspicions were still cherished
that Demaratus was really the son of his mother’s first husband.<a
id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a></p>

<p>Of these suspicions, Kleomenês now resolved to avail himself,
exciting Leotychidês, the next heir in the Prokleid line of kings,
to impugn publicly the legitimacy of Demaratus; engaging to second
him with all his influence as next in order for the crown, and
exacting in return a promise that he would support the intervention
against Ægina. Leotychidês was animated not merely by ambition, but
also by private enmity against Demaratus, who had disappointed him
of his intended bride: he warmly entered into the scheme, arraigned
Demaratus as no true Herakleid, and produced evidence to prove
the original doubts expressed by Aristo. A serious dispute was
thus raised at Sparta, and Kleomenês, espousing the pretensions of
Leotychidês, recommended that the question as to the legitimacy of
Demaratus should be decided by reference to the Delphian oracle.
Through the influence of Kobôn, a powerful native of Delphi, he
procured from the Pythian priestess an answer pronouncing<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[p. 327]</span> that Demaratus was
not the son of Aristo.<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611"
class="fnanchor">[611]</a> Leotychidês thus became king of the
Prokleid line, while Demaratus descended into a private station, and
was elected at the ensuing solemnity of the Gymnopædia to an official
function. The new king, unable to repress a burst of triumphant
spite, sent an attendant to ask him, in the public theatre, how he
felt as an officer after having once been a king. Stung with this
insult, Demaratus replied that he himself had tried them both, and
that Leotychidês might in time come to try them both also: the
question, he added, shall bear its fruit,—great evil, or great good,
to Sparta. So saying, he covered his face and retired home from the
theatre,—offered a solemn farewell sacrifice at the altar of Zeus
Herkeios, and solemnly adjured his mother to declare to him who
his real father was,—then at once quitted Sparta for Elis, under
pretence of going to consult the Delphian oracle.<a id="FNanchor_612"
href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a></p>

<p>Demaratus was well known to be a high-spirited and ambitious
man,—noted, among other things, as the only Lacedæmonian king down
to the time of Herodotus who had ever gained a chariot victory
at Olympia; and Kleomenês and Leotychidês became alarmed at the
mischief which he might do them in exile. By the law of Sparta, no
Herakleid was allowed to establish his residence out of the country,
on pain of death: this marks the sentiment of the Lacedæmonians, and
Demaratus was not the less likely to give trouble because they had
pronounced him illegitimate.<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613"
class="fnanchor">[613]</a> Accordingly they sent in pursuit of him,
and seized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[p. 328]</span> him
in the island of Zakynthus. But the Zakynthians would not consent
to surrender him, so that he passed unobstructed into Asia, where
he presented himself to Darius, and was received with abundant
favors and presents.<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614"
class="fnanchor">[614]</a> We shall hereafter find him the companion
of Xerxês, giving to that monarch advice such as, if it had been
acted upon, would have proved the ruin of Grecian independence; to
which, however, he would have been even more dangerous, if he had
remained at home as king of Sparta.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Kleomenês, having obtained a consentient colleague in
Leotychidês, went with him over to Ægina, eager to revenge himself
for the affront which had been put upon him. To the requisition and
presence of the two kings jointly, the Æginetans did not dare to
oppose any resistance. Kleomenês made choice of ten citizens, eminent
for wealth, station, and influence, among whom were Krius and another
person named Kasambus, the two most powerful men in the island.
Conveying them away to Athens, he deposited them as hostages in the
hands of the Athenians.<a id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615"
class="fnanchor">[615]</a></p>

<p>It was in this state that the affairs of Athens and of Greece
generally were found by the Persian armament which landed at
Marathon, the progress of which we are now about to follow. And the
events just recounted were of material importance, considered in
their indirect bearing upon the success of that armament. Sparta had
now, on the invitation of Athens, assumed to herself for the first
time a formal Pan-Hellenic primacy, her ancient rival Argos being too
much broken to contest it,—her two kings, at this juncture unanimous,
employ their presiding interference in coercing Ægina, and placing
Æginetan hostages in the hands of Athens. The Æginetans would not
have been unwilling to purchase victory over a neighbor and rival at
the cost of submission to Persia, and it was the Spartan interference
only which restrained them from assailing Athens conjointly with the
Persian invaders; thus leaving the hands of the latter free, and her
courage undiminished, for the coming trial.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a vast Persian force, brought together in consequence
of the preparation made during the last two years in<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[p. 329]</span> every part of the
empire, had assembled in the Aleïan plain of Kilikia, near the
sea. A fleet of six hundred armed triremes, together with many
transports, both of men and horses, was brought hither for their
embarkation: the troops were put on board, and sailed along the
coast to Samos in Ionia. The Ionic and Æolic Greeks constituted an
important part of this armament, and the Athenian exile Hippias was
on board as guide and auxiliary in the attack of Attica. The generals
were Datis, a Median,<a id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616"
class="fnanchor">[616]</a>—and Artaphernês, son of the satrap of
Sardis, so named, and nephew of Darius. We may remark that Datis is
the first person of Median lineage who is mentioned as appointed
to high command after the accession of Darius, which had been
preceded and marked, as I have noticed in a former chapter, by an
outbreak of hostile nationality between the Medes and Persians.
Their instructions were, generally, to reduce to subjection and
tribute all such Greeks as had not already given earth and water.
But Darius directed them most particularly to conquer Eretria and
Athens, and to bring the inhabitants as slaves into his presence.<a
id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a>
These orders were literally meant, and probably neither the generals
nor the soldiers of this vast armament doubted that they would be
literally executed; and that before the end of the year, the wives,
or rather the widows, of men like Themistoklês and Aristeidês would
be seen among a mournful train of Athenian prisoners, on the road
from Sardis to Susa, thus accomplishing the wish expressed by queen
Atossa at the instance of Dêmokêdês.</p>

<p>The recent terrific storm near Mount Athos deterred the
Persians from following the example of Mardonius, and taking their
course by the Hellespont and Thrace. It was resolved to strike
straight across the Ægean<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618"
class="fnanchor">[618]</a> (the mode of attack which
intelligent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[p. 330]</span>
Greeks like Themistoklês most feared, even after the repulse of
Xerxês), from Samos to Eubœa, attacking the intermediate islands in
the way. Among those islands was Naxos, which ten years before had
stood a long siege, and gallantly repelled the Persian Megabatês
with the Milesian Aristagoras. It was one of the main objects of
Datis to efface this stain on the Persian arms, and to take a signal
revenge on the Naxians.<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619"
class="fnanchor">[619]</a> Crossing from Samos to Naxos, he landed
his army on the island, which was found an easier prize than he had
expected. The terrified citizens, abandoning their town, fled with
their families to the highest summits of their mountains; while the
Persians, seizing as slaves a few who had been dilatory in flight,
burnt the undefended town with its edifices sacred and profane.</p>

<p>Immense, indeed, was the difference in Grecian sentiment towards
the Persians, created by the terror-striking reconquest of Ionia,
and by the exhibition of a large Phenician fleet in the Ægean.
The strength of Naxos was the same now as it had been before the
Ionic revolt, and the successful resistance then made might have
been supposed likely to nerve the courage of its inhabitants. Yet
such is the fear now inspired by a Persian armament, that the
eight thousand Naxian hoplites abandon their town and their gods
without striking a blow,<a id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620"
class="fnanchor">[620]</a> and think of nothing but personal safety
for themselves and their families. A sad augury for Athens and
Eretria!</p>

<p>From Naxos, Datis despatched his fleet round the other Cyclades
islands, requiring from each, hostages for fidelity and a contingent
to increase his army. With the sacred island of Delos, however,
he dealt tenderly and respectfully. The Delians had fled before
his approach to Tênos, but Datis sent a herald to invite them back
again, promised to preserve their persons and property inviolate, and
proclaimed that he had received express orders from the Great King to
reverence the island in which Apollo and Artemis were born. His acts
corresponded with this language; for the fleet was not allowed to
touch the island,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[p. 331]</span>
and he himself, landing with only a few attendants, offered a
magnificent sacrifice at the altar. A large portion of his armament
consisted of Ionic Greeks, and this pronounced respect to the island
of Delos may probably be ascribed to the desire of satisfying their
religious feelings; for in their days of early freedom, this island
had been the scene of their solemn periodical festivals, as I have
already more than once remarked.</p>

<p>Pursuing his course without resistance along the islands, and
demanding reinforcements as well as hostages from each, Datis at
length touched the southernmost portion of Eubœa,—the town of
Karystus and its territory.<a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621"
class="fnanchor">[621]</a> The Karystians, though at first refusing
either to give hostages or to furnish any reinforcements against
their friends and neighbors, were speedily compelled to submission by
the aggressive devastation of the invaders. This was the first taste
of resistance which Datis had yet experienced; and the facility with
which it was overcome gave him a promising omen as to his success
against Eretria, whither he soon arrived.</p>

<p>The destination of the armament was no secret to the inhabitants
of this fated city, among whom consternation, aggravated by intestine
differences, was the reigning sentiment. They made application to
Athens for aid, which was readily and conveniently afforded to them
by means of those four thousand kleruchs, or out-citizens, whom
the Athenians had planted sixteen years before in the neighboring
territory of Chalkis. Notwithstanding this reinforcement, however,
many of them despaired of defending the city, and thought only of
seeking shelter on the unassailable summits of the island, as the
more numerous and powerful Naxians had already done before them;
while another party, treacherously seeking their own profit out of
the public calamity, lay in wait for an opportunity of betraying
the city to the Persians.<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622"
class="fnanchor">[622]</a> Though a public resolution was taken to
defend<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[p. 332]</span> the city,
yet so manifest was the absence of that stoutness of heart which
could alone avail to save it, that a leading Eretrian named Æschinês
was not ashamed to forewarn the four thousand Athenian allies of the
coming treason, and urge them to save themselves before it was too
late. They followed his advice and passed over to Attica by way of
Orôpus; while the Persians disembarked their troops, and even their
horses, in expectation that the Eretrians would come out and fight,
at Tamynæ and other places in the territory. As the Eretrians did
not come out, they proceeded to lay siege to the city, and for some
days met with a brave resistance, so that the loss on both sides
was considerable. At length two of the leading citizens, Euphorbus
and Philagrus, with others, betrayed Eretria to the besiegers; its
temples were burnt, and its inhabitants dragged into slavery.<a
id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a>
It is impossible to credit the exaggerated statement of Plato,
which is applied by him to the Persians at Eretria, as it had
been before applied by Herodotus to the Persians at Chios and
Samos,—that they swept the territory clean of inhabitants by
joining hands and forming a line across its whole breadth.<a
id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a>
Evidently, this is an idea illustrating the possible effects of
numbers and ruinous conquest, which has been woven into the tissue
of historical statements, like so many other illustrative ideas
in the writings of Greek authors. That a large proportion of the
inhabitants were carried away as prisoners, there can be no doubt.
But the traitors who betrayed the town were spared and rewarded by
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[p. 333]</span> Persians,<a
id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> and
we see plainly that either some of the inhabitants must have been
left or new settlers introduced, when we find the Eretrians reckoned
ten years afterwards among the opponents of Xerxês.</p>

<p>Datis had thus accomplished with little or no resistance one of
the two express objects commanded by Darius, and his army was elated
with the confident hope of soon completing the other. Alter halting
a few days at Eretria, and depositing in the neighboring islet of
Ægilia the prisoners recently captured, he reëmbarked his army to
cross over to Attica, and landed in the memorable bay of Marathon
on the eastern coast,—the spot indicated by the despot Hippias, who
now landed along with the Persians, twenty years after his expulsion
from the government. Forty-seven years had elapsed since he had
made as a young man this same passage, from Eretria to Marathon, in
conjunction with his father Peisistratus, on the occasion of the
second restoration of the latter. On that previous occasion, the
force accompanying the father had been immeasurably inferior to that
which now seconded the son; yet it had been found amply sufficient
to carry him in triumph to Athens, with feeble opposition from
citizens alike irresolute and disunited. And the march of Hippias
from Marathon to Athens would now have been equally easy, as it was
doubtless conceived to be by himself, both in his waking hopes and
in the dream which Herodotus mentions,—had not the Athenians whom he
found been men radically different from those whom he had left.</p>

<p>To that great renewal of the Athenian character, under the
democratical institutions which had subsisted since the dispossession
of Hippias, I have already pointed attention in a former chapter.
The modifications introduced by Kleisthenês in the constitution
had now existed eighteen or nineteen years, without any attempt to
overthrow them by violence. The Ten Tribes,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_334">[p. 334]</span> each with its constituent demes,
had become a part of the established habits of the country, and
the citizens had become accustomed to exercise a genuine and
self-determined decision in their assemblies, political as well
as judicial; while even the senate of Areopagus, renovated by the
nine annual archons successively chosen who passed into it after
their year of office, had also become identified in feeling with
the constitution of Kleisthenês. Individual citizens, doubtless,
remained partisans in secret, and perhaps correspondents of Hippias;
but the mass of citizens, in every scale of life, could look upon
his return with nothing but terror and aversion. With what degree
of newly-acquired energy the democratical Athenians could act
in defence of their country and institutions, has already been
related in a former chapter; though unfortunately we possess few
particulars of Athenian history during the decade preceding 490
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, nor can we follow in detail the working of
the government. The new form, however, which Athenian politics had
assumed becomes partially manifest, when we observe the three leaders
who stand prominent at this important epoch,—Miltiadês, Themistoklês,
and Aristeidês.</p>

<p>The first of the three had returned to Athens, three or four years
before the approach of Datis, after six or seven years’ absence in
the Chersonesus of Thrace, whither he had been originally sent by
Hippias about the year 517-516 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, to inherit the
property as well as the supremacy of his uncle the œkist Miltiadês.
As despot of the Chersonese, and as one of the subjects of Persia,
he had been among the Ionians who accompanied Darius to the Danube
in his Scythian expedition, and he had been the author of that
memorable recommendation which Histiæus and the other despots did
not think it their interest to follow,—of destroying the bridge and
leaving the Persian king to perish. Subsequently, he had been unable
to remain permanently in the Chersonese, for reasons which have
before been noticed; yet he seems to have occupied it during the
period of the Ionic revolt.<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626"
class="fnanchor">[626]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[p.
335]</span> What part he took in that revolt we do not know. But
he availed himself of the period while the Persian satraps were
employed in suppressing it, and deprived of the mastery of the sea,
to expel, in conjunction with forces from Athens, both the Persian
garrison and Pelasgic inhabitants from the islands of Lemnos and
Imbros. The extinction of the Ionic revolt threatened him with ruin;
so that when the Phenician fleet, in the summer following the capture
of Milêtus, made its conquering appearance in the Hellespont, he
was forced to escape rapidly to Athens with his immediate friends
and property, and with a small squadron of five ships. One of
these ships, commanded by his son Metiochus, was actually captured
between the Chersonese and Imbros; and the Phenicians were most
eager to capture himself,<a id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627"
class="fnanchor">[627]</a>—inasmuch as he was personally odious
to Darius from his strenuous recommendation to destroy the bridge
over the Danube. On arriving at Athens, after his escape from
the Phenician fleet, he was brought to trial before the judicial
popular assembly for alleged misgovernment in the Chersonese,
or for what Herodotus calls “his despotism” there exercised.<a
id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a>
Nor is it improbable, that the Athenian citizens settled in that
peninsula may have had good reason to complain of him,—the more so
as he had carried out with him the maxims of government prevalent at
Athens under the Peisistratids, and had in his pay a body of Thracian
mercenaries. However, the people at Athens honorably acquitted
him, probably in part from the reputation which he had obtained
as conqueror of Lemnos;<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629"
class="fnanchor">[629]</a> and he was one of the ten annually-elected
generals of the republic, during the year of this Persian
expedition,—chosen at the beginning of the Attic year, shortly after
the summer solstice, at a time when Datis and Hippias had actually
sailed, and were known to be approaching.</p>

<p>The character of Miltiadês is one of great bravery and
decision,—qualities preëminently useful to his country on the
present crisis, and the more useful as he was under the strongest
motive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">[p. 336]</span> to put
them forth, from the personal hostility of Darius towards him; but he
does not peculiarly belong to the democracy of Kleisthenês, like his
younger contemporaries Themistoklês and Aristeidês. The two latter
are specimens of a class of men new at Athens since the expulsion
of Hippias, and contrasting forcibly with Peisistratus, Lykurgus,
and Megaklês, the political leaders of the preceding generation.
Themistoklês and Aristeidês, different as they were in disposition,
agree in being politicians of the democratical stamp, exercising
ascendency by and through the people,—devoting their time to the
discharge of public duties, and to the frequent discussions in the
political and judicial meetings of the people,—manifesting those
combined powers of action, comprehension, and persuasive speech,
which gradually accustomed the citizens to look to them as advisers
as well as leaders,—but always subject to criticism and accusation
from unfriendly rivals, and exercising such rivalry towards each
other with an asperity constantly increasing. Instead of Attica,
disunited and torn into armed factions, as it had been forty years
before,—the Diakrii under one man, and the Parali and Pedieis
under others,—we have now Attica one and indivisible; regimented
into a body of orderly hearers in the Pnyx, appointing and holding
to accountability the magistrates, and open to be addressed by
Themistoklês, Aristeidês, or any other citizen who can engage their
attention.</p>

<p>Neither Themistoklês nor Aristeidês could boast of a lineage
of gods and heroes, like the Æakid Miltiadês:<a id="FNanchor_630"
href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> both were of middling
station and circumstances. Aristeidês, son of Lysimachus, was on
both sides of pure Athenian blood. But the wife of Neoklês, father
of Themistoklês, was a foreign woman of Thrace or of Karia: and such
an alliance is the less surprising, since Themistoklês must have
been born during the dynasty of the Peisistratids, when the status
of an Athenian citizen had not yet acquired its political value.
There was a marked contrast between these two eminent men,—those
points which stood most conspicuous in the one, being comparatively
deficient in the other. In the description of Themistoklês, which we
have the advantage of finding briefly sketched by Thucydidês, the
circumstance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[p. 337]</span>
most emphatically brought out is, his immense force of spontaneous
invention and apprehension, without any previous aid either from
teaching or gradual practice. The might of unassisted nature<a
id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a>
was never so strikingly exhibited as in him: he conceived the
complications of a present embarrassment, and divined the chances
of a mysterious future, with equal sagacity and equal quickness:
the right expedient seemed to flash upon his mind extempore, even
in the most perplexing contingencies, without the least necessity
for premeditation. Nor was he less distinguished for daring and
resource in action. When engaged on any joint affairs, his superior
competence marked him out as the leader for others to follow, and
no business, however foreign to his experience, ever took him by
surprise, or came wholly amiss to him. Such is the remarkable
picture which Thucydidês draws of a countryman whose death nearly
coincided in time with his own birth: the untutored readiness and
universality of Themistoklês probably formed in his mind a contrast
to the more elaborate discipline, and careful preliminary study,
with which the statesmen of his own day—and Periklês especially,
the greatest of them—approached the consideration and discussion
of public affairs. Themistoklês had received no teaching from
philosophers, sophists, and rhetors, who were the instructors of
well-born youth in the days of Thucydidês, and whom Aristophanês, the
contemporary of the latter, so unmercifully derides,—treating such
instruction as worse than nothing, and extolling, in comparison with
it, the unlettered courage, with mere gymnastic accomplishments, of
the victors at Marathon.<a id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632"
class="fnanchor">[632]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[p.
338]</span> There is no evidence in the mind of Thucydidês of any
such undue contempt towards his own age. Though the same terms of
contrast are tacitly present to his mind, he seems to treat the great
capacity of Themistoklês as the more a matter of wonder, since it
sprung up without that preliminary cultivation which had gone to the
making of Periklês.</p>

<p>The general character given of Plutarch,<a id="FNanchor_633"
href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> though many of his
anecdotes are both trifling and apocryphal, is quite consistent with
the brief sketch just cited from Thucydidês. Themistoklês had an
unbounded passion,—not merely for glory, insomuch that the laurels
of Miltiadês acquired at Marathon deprived him of rest,—but also
for display of every kind. He was eager to vie with men richer
than himself in showy exhibition,—one great source, though not the
only source, of popularity at Athens,—nor was he at all scrupulous
in procuring the means of doing so. Besides being assiduous in
attendance at the ekklesia and the dikastery, he knew most of
the citizens by name, and was always ready with advice to them
in their private affairs. Moreover, he possessed all the tactics
of an expert party-man in conciliating political friends and in
defeating political enemies; and though he was in the early part of
his life sincerely bent upon the upholding and aggrandizement of
his country, and was on some most critical occasions of unspeakable
value to it,—yet on the whole his morality was as reckless as his
intelligence was eminent. He will be found grossly corrupt in the
exercise of power, and employing tortuous means, sometimes indeed
for ends in themselves honorable and patriotic, but sometimes also
merely for enriching himself. He ended a glorious life by years
of deep disgrace, with the forfeiture of all Hellenic esteem and
brotherhood,—a rich man, an exile, a traitor, and a pensioner of
the Great King, pledged to undo his own previous work of liberation
accomplished at the victory of Salamis.</p>

<p>Of Aristeidês we possess unfortunately no description from the
hand of Thucydidês; yet his character is so simple and consistent,
that we may safely accept the brief but unqualified encomium
of Herodotus and Plato, expanded as it is in the biog<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_339">[p. 339]</span>raphy of Plutarch
and Cornelius Nepos,<a id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634"
class="fnanchor">[634]</a> however little the details of the
latter can be trusted. Aristeidês was inferior to Themistoklês
in resource, quickness, flexibility, and power of coping with
difficulties; but incomparably superior to him, as well as to
other rivals and contemporaries, in integrity, public as well as
private; inaccessible to pecuniary temptations, as well as to other
seductive influences, and deserving as well as enjoying the highest
measure of personal confidence. He is described as the peculiar
friend of Kleisthenês, the first founder of the democracy,<a
id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a>—as
pursuing a straight and single-handed course in political life,
with no solicitude for party ties, and with little care either to
conciliate friends or to offend enemies,—as unflinching in the
exposure of corrupt practices, by whomsoever committed or upheld,—as
earning for himself the lofty surname of the Just, not less by his
judicial decisions in the capacity of archon, than by his equity in
private arbitrations, and even his candor in political dispute,—and
as manifesting throughout a long public life, full of tempting
opportunities, an uprightness without flaw and beyond all suspicion,
recognized equally by his bitter contemporary the poet Timokreon,<a
id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> and
by the allies of Athens, upon whom he first assessed the tribute.
Few of the leading men in any part of Greece were without some taint
on their reputation, deserved or undeserved, in regard to pecuniary
probity; but whoever became notoriously recognized as possessing this
vital quality, acquired by means of it a firmer hold on the public
esteem than even eminent talents could confer. Thucydidês ranks
conspicuous probity among the first of the many ascendent qualities
possessed by Periklês;<a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637"
class="fnanchor">[637]</a> and Nikias, equal to him in this
respect, though immeasurably inferior in every other, owed to it a
still larger proportion of that exaggerated confidence which the
Athenian people continued so long to repose in him. The abilities of
Aristeidês, though apparently adequate to every occasion on which
he was engaged, and only inferior when we compare him with so<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[p. 340]</span> remarkable a man as
Themistoklês, were put in the shade by this incorruptible probity,
which procured for him, however, along with the general esteem, no
inconsiderable amount of private enmity from jobbers whom he exposed,
and even some jealousy from persons who heard it proclaimed with
offensive ostentation.</p>

<p>We are told that a rustic and unlettered citizen gave his
ostracizing vote, and expressed his dislike against Aristeidês,<a
id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a>
on the simple ground that he was tired of hearing him always called
the Just. Now the purity of the most honorable man will not bear to
be so boastfully talked of as if he were the only honorable man in
the country: the less it is obtruded, the more deeply and cordially
will it be felt: and the story just alluded to, whether true or
false, illustrates that natural reaction of feeling, produced by
absurd encomiasts, or perhaps by insidious enemies under the mask
of encomiasts, who trumpeted forth Aristeidês as <i>The</i> Just man at
Attica, so as to wound the legitimate dignity of every one else.
Neither indiscreet friends nor artful enemies, however, could rob
him of the lasting esteem of his countrymen; which he enjoyed, with
intervals of their displeasure, to the end of his life. Though he
was ostracized during a part of the period between the battle of
Marathon and Salamis,—at a time when the rivalry between him and
Themistoklês was so violent that both could not remain at Athens
without peril,—yet the dangers of Athens during the invasion of
Xerxês brought him back before the ten years of exile were expired.
His fortune, originally very moderate, was still farther diminished
during the course of his life, so that he died very poor, and the
state was obliged to lend aid to his children.</p>

<p>Such were the characters of Themistoklês and Aristeidês, the
two earliest leaders thrown up by the Athenian democracy. Half a
century before, Themistoklês would have been an active partisan in
the faction of the Parali or the Pedieis, while Aristeidês would
probably have remained an unnoticed citizen. At the present period of
Athenian history, the characters of the soldier, the magistrate, and
the orator, were intimately blended together in a citizen who stood
forward for eminence, though they tended more and more to divide
themselves during the en<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[p.
341]</span>suing century and a half. Aristeidês and Miltiadês
were both elected among the ten generals, each for his respective
tribe, in the year of the expedition of Datis across the Ægean, and
probably even after that expedition was known to be on its voyage.
Moreover, we are led to suspect from a passage in Plutarch, that
Themistoklês also was general of his tribe on the same occasion,<a
id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a>
though this is doubtful; but it is certain that he fought at
Marathon. The ten generals had jointly the command of the army, each
of them taking his turn to exercise it for a day: in addition to
the ten, moreover, the third archon, or polemarch, was considered
as eleventh in the military council. The polemarch of this year was
Kallimachus of Aphidnæ.<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640"
class="fnanchor">[640]</a> Such were the chiefs of the military
force, and to a great degree the administrators of foreign affairs,
at the time when the four thousand Athenian kleruchs, or settlers
planted in Eubœa,—escaping from Eretria, now invested by the
Persians,—brought word to their countrymen at home that the fall
of that city was impending. It was obvious that the Persian host
would proceed from Eretria forthwith against Athens, and a few days
afterwards Hippias disembarked them at Marathon, whither the Athenian
army marched to meet them.</p>

<p>Of the feeling which now prevailed at Athens we have no
details, but doubtless the alarm was hardly inferior to that
which had been felt at Eretria: dissenting opinions were heard as
to the proper steps to be taken, nor were suspicions of treason
wanting. Pheidippidês the courier was sent to Sparta immediately
to solicit assistance; and such was his prodigious activity, that
he performed this journey of one hundred and fifty miles, on foot,
in forty-eight hours.<a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641"
class="fnanchor">[641]</a> He revealed to the ephors that Eretria
was already enslaved, and entreated their assistance to avert the
same fate from Athens, the most ancient city in Greece. The Spartan
authorities readily promised their aid, but unfortunately it was
now the ninth day of the moon: ancient law or custom forbade them
to march, in this month at least, during the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_342">[p. 342]</span> last quarter before the full moon; but
after the full they engaged to march without delay. Five days’ delay
at this critical moment might prove the utter ruin of the endangered
city; yet the reason assigned seems to have been no pretence on the
part of the Spartans. It was mere blind tenacity of ancient habit,
which we shall find to abate, though never to disappear, as we
advance in their history.<a id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642"
class="fnanchor">[642]</a> Indeed, their delay in marching to rescue
Attica from Mardonius, eleven years afterwards, at the imminent
hazard of alienating Athens and ruining the Hellenic cause, marks
the same selfish dulness. But the reason now given certainly looked
very like a pretence, so that the Athenians could indulge no certain
assurance that the Spartan troops would start even when the full moon
arrived.</p>

<p>In this respect the answer brought by Pheidippidês was
mischievous, as it tended to increase that uncertainty and indecision
which already prevailed among the ten generals, as to the proper
steps for meeting the invaders. Partly, perhaps, in reliance on this
expected Spartan help, five out of the ten generals were decidedly
averse to an immediate engagement with the Persians; while Miltiadês
with the remaining four strenuously urged that not a moment should
be lost in bringing the enemy to action, without leaving time to the
timid and the treacherous to establish correspondence with Hippias,
and to take some active step for paralyzing all united action on the
part of the citizens. This most momentous debate, upon which the
fate of Athens hung, is represented by Herodotus to have occurred
at Marathon, after the army had marched out and taken post there
within sight of the Persians; while Cornelius Nepos describes it
as having been raised before the army quitted the city,—upon the
question, whether it was prudent to meet the enemy at all in the
field, or to confine the defence to the city and the sacred rock.
Inaccurate as this latter author generally is, his statement seems
more probable here than that of Herodotus. For the ten generals would
scarcely march out of Athens to Marathon without having previously
resolved to fight: moreover, the question between fighting in the
field or resisting behind the walls, which had already been raised
at Eretria, seems the natural point on which<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_343">[p. 343]</span> the five mistrustful generals would
take their stand. And probably indeed Miltiadês himself, if debarred
from immediate action, would have preferred to hold possession of
Athens, and prevent any treacherous movement from breaking out
there,—rather than to remain inactive on the hills, watching the
Persians at Marathon, with the chance of a detachment from their
numerous fleet sailing round to Phalêrum, and thus distracting, by a
double attack, both the city and the camp.</p>

<p>However this may be, the equal division of opinion among the
ten generals, whether manifested at Marathon or at Athens, is
certain,—so that Miltiadês had to await the casting-vote of the
polemarch Kallimachus. To him he represented emphatically the danger
of delay, and the chance of some traitorous intrigue occurring to
excite disunion and aggravate the alarms of the citizens. Nothing
could prevent such treason from breaking out, with all its terrific
consequences of enslavement to the Persians and to Hippias, except
a bold, decisive, and immediate attack,—the success of which he
(Miltiadês) was prepared to guarantee. Fortunately for Athens, the
polemarch embraced the opinion of Miltiadês, and the seditious
movements which were preparing did not show themselves until after
the battle had been gained. Aristeidês and Themistoklês are both
recorded to have seconded Miltiadês warmly in this proposal,—while
all the other generals agreed in surrendering to Miltiadês their
days of command, so as to make him, as much as they could, the sole
leader of the army. It is said that the latter awaited the day of his
own regular turn before he fought the battle.<a id="FNanchor_643"
href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> Yet considering the
eagerness which he displayed to bring on an immediate and decisive
action, we cannot suppose that he would have admitted any serious
postponement upon such a punctilio.</p>

<p>While the army were mustered on the ground sacred to Heraklês
near Marathon, with the Persians and their fleet occupying the
plain and shore beneath, and in preparation for immediate action,
they were joined by the whole force of the little town of Platæa,
consisting of about one thousand hoplites, who had marched directly
from their own city to the spot, along the southern range of
Kithærôn and passing through Dekeleia. We are<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_344">[p. 344]</span> not told that they had been invited,
and very probably the Athenians had never thought of summoning aid
from this unimportant neighbor, in whose behalf they had taken upon
themselves a lasting feud with Thebes and the Bœotian league.<a
id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a>
Their coming on this important occasion seems to have been a
spontaneous effort of gratitude which ought not to be the less
commended because their interests were really wrapped up in those of
Athens,—since if the latter had been conquered, nothing could have
saved Platæa from being subdued by the Thebans,—yet many a Grecian
town would have disregarded both generous impulse and rational
calculation, in the fear of provoking a new and terrific enemy.
If we summon up to our imaginations all the circumstances of the
case,—which it requires some effort to do, because our authorities
come from the subsequent generations, after Greece had ceased
to fear the Persians,—we shall be sensible that this volunteer
march of the whole Platæan force to Marathon is one of the most
affecting incidents of all Grecian history. Upon Athens generally
it produced an indelible impression, commemorated ever afterwards
in the public prayers of the Athenian herald,<a id="FNanchor_645"
href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> and repaid by a
grant to the Platæans of the full civil rights—seemingly without
the political rights—of Athenian citizens. Upon the Athenians then
marshalled at Marathon its effect must have been unspeakably powerful
and encouraging, as a proof that they were not altogether isolated
from Greece, and as an unexpected countervailing stimulus under
circumstances so full of hazard.</p>

<p>Of the two opposing armies at Marathon, we are told that the
Athenians were ten thousand hoplites, either including or besides
the one thousand who came from Platæa.<a id="FNanchor_646"
href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> Nor is this
state<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[p. 345]</span>ment in
itself improbable, though it does not come from Herodotus, who is
our only really valuable authority on the case, and who mentions
no numerical total. Indeed, the number named seems smaller than we
should have expected, considering that no less than four thousand
kleruchs, or out-settled citizens, had just come over from Eubœa. A
sufficient force of citizens must of course have been left behind
to defend the city. The numbers of the Persians we cannot be said
to know at all, nor is there anything certain except that they were
greatly superior to the Greeks. We hear from Herodotus that their
armament originally consisted of six hundred ships of war, but we
are not told how many separate transports there were; and, moreover,
reinforcements had been procured as they came across the Ægean from
the islands successively conquered. The aggregate crews on board of
all their ships must have been between one hundred and fifty thousand
and two hundred thousand men; but what proportion of these were
fighting men, or how many actually did fight at Marathon, we have
no means of determining.<a id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647"
class="fnanchor">[647]</a> There were a<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_346">[p. 346]</span> certain proportion of cavalry, and some
transports expressly prepared for the conveyance of horses: moreover,
Herodotus tells us that Hippias selected the plain of Marathon for
a landing place, because it was the most convenient spot in Attica
for cavalry movements,—though it is singular, that in the battle the
cavalry are not mentioned.</p>

<p>Marathon, situated near to a bay on the eastern coast of Attica,
and in a direction E.N.E. from Athens, is divided by the high ridge
of Mount Pentelikus from the city, with which it communicated by
two roads, one to the north, another to the south of that mountain.
Of these two roads, the northern, at once the shortest and the most
difficult, is twenty-two miles in length: the southern—longer but
more easy, and the only one practicable for chariots—is twenty-six
miles in length, or about six and a half hours of computed march.
It passed between mounts Pentelikus and Hymettus, through the
ancient demes of Gargêttus and Pallênê, and was the road by which
Peisistratus and Hippias, when they landed at Marathon forty-seven
years before, had marched to Athens. The bay of Marathon, sheltered
by a projecting cape from the northward, affords both deep water
and a shore convenient for landing; while “its plain (says a
careful modern observer<a id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648"
class="fnanchor">[648]</a>) extends in a perfect level along
this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[p. 347]</span> fine bay,
and is in length about six miles, in breadth never less than about
one mile and a half. Two marshes bound the extremities of the plain:
the southern is not very large, and is almost dry at the conclusion
of the great heats; but the northern, which generally covers
considerably more than a square mile, offers several parts which
are at all seasons impassable. Both, however, leave a broad, firm,
sandy beach between them and the sea. The uninterrupted flatness of
the plain is hardly relieved by a single tree; and an amphitheatre
of rocky hills and rugged mountains separates it from the rest of
Attica, over the lower ridges of which some steep and difficult paths
communicate with the districts of the interior.”</p>

<p>The position occupied by Miltiadês before the battle, identified
as it was to all subsequent Athenians by the sacred grove of Hêraklês
near Marathon, was probably on some portion of the high ground above
this plain, and Cornelius Nepos tells us that he protected it from
the attacks of the Persian cavalry by felled trees obstructing the
approach. The Persians occupied a position on the plain; while their
fleet was ranged along the beach, and Hippias himself marshalled
them for the battle.<a id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649"
class="fnanchor">[649]</a> The native Persians and Sakæ, the
best troops in the whole army, were placed in the centre, which
they considered as the post of honor,<a id="FNanchor_650"
href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_348">[p. 348]</span> and which was occupied by the Persian
king himself, when present at a battle. The right wing was so
regarded by the Greeks, and the polemarch Kallimachus had the command
of it; the hoplites being arranged in the order of their respective
tribes from right to left, and at the extreme left stood the
Platæans. It was necessary for Miltiadês to present a front equal,
or nearly equal, to that of the more numerous Persian host, in order
to guard himself from being taken in flank: and with this view he
drew up the central tribes, including the Leontis and Antiochis, in
shallow files, and occupying a large breadth of ground; while each of
the wings was in stronger and deeper order, so as to make his attack
efficient on both sides. His whole army consisted of hoplites, with
some slaves as unarmed or light-armed attendants, but without either
bowmen or cavalry. Nor could the Persians have been very strong in
this latter force, seeing that their horses had to be transported
across the Ægean. But the elevated position of Miltiadês enabled
them to take some measure of the numbers under his command, and the
entire absence of cavalry among their enemies could not but confirm
the confidence with which a long career of uninterrupted victory had
impressed their generals.</p>

<p>At length the sacrifices in the Greek camp were favorable
for battle, and Miltiadês, who had everything to gain by coming
immediately to close quarters, ordered his army to advance at
a running step over the interval of one mile which separated
the two armies. This rapid forward movement, accompanied by the
war-cry, or pæan, which always animated the charge of the Greek
soldier, astounded the Persian army; who construed it as an act of
desperate courage, little short of insanity, in a body not only
small but destitute of cavalry or archers,—but who, at the same
time, felt their conscious superiority sink within them. It<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[p. 349]</span> seems to have been long
remembered also among the Greeks as the peculiar characteristic of
the battle of Marathon, and Herodotus tells us that the Athenians
were the first Greeks who ever charged at a run.<a id="FNanchor_651"
href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> It doubtless
operated beneficially in rendering the Persian cavalry and archers
comparatively innocuous, but we may reasonably suppose that it
also disordered the Athenian ranks, and that when they reached the
Persian front, they were both out of breath and unsteady in that
line of presented spears and shields which constituted their force.
On the two wings, where the files were deep, this disorder produced
no mischievous effect: the Persians, after a certain resistance,
were overborne and driven back. But in the centre, where the files
were shallow, and where, moreover, the native Persians and other
choice troops of the army were posted, the breathless and disordered
Athenian hoplites found themselves in far greater difficulties.
The tribes Leontis and Antiochis, with Themistoklês and Aristeidês
among them, were actually defeated, broken, driven back, and pursued
by the Persians and Sakæ.<a id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652"
class="fnanchor">[652]</a> Miltiadês<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_350">[p. 350]</span> seems to have foreseen the possibility
of such a check, when he found himself compelled to diminish so
materially the depth of his centre: for his wings, having routed
the enemies opposed to them, were stayed from pursuit until the
centre was extricated, and the Persians and Sakæ put to flight along
with the rest. The pursuit then became general, and the Persians
were chased to their ships ranged in line along the shore: some of
them became involved in the impassable marsh and there perished.<a
id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a>
The Athenians tried to set the ships on fire, but the defence
here was both vigorous and successful,—several of the forward
warriors of Athens were slain,—and only seven ships out of the
numerous fleet destroyed.<a id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654"
class="fnanchor">[654]</a> This part of the battle terminated to
the advantage of the Persians. They repulsed the Athenians from
the sea-shore, and secured a safe reëmbarkation; leaving few or no
prisoners, but a rich spoil of tents and equipments which had been
disembarked and could not be carried away.</p>

<p>Herodotus estimates the number of those who fell on the Persian
side in this memorable action at six thousand four hundred men:
the number of Athenian dead is accurately known, since all were
collected for the last solemn obsequies,—they were one hundred
and ninety-two. How many were wounded, we do not hear. The brave
Kallimachus the polemarch, and Stesilaus, one of the ten generals,
were among the slain; together with Kynegeirus son of Euphorion,
who, in laying hold on the poop-staff of one of the vessels, had his
hand cut off by an axe,<a id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655"
class="fnanchor">[655]</a> and died of the wound. He was brother of
the poet Æschylus, himself present at the fight; to whose imagination
this battle at the ships must have emphatically recalled the
fifteenth book of the Iliad.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[p.
351]</span> Both these Athenian generals are said to have perished in
the assault of the ships, apparently the hottest part of the combat.
The statement of the Persian loss as given by Herodotus appears
moderate and reasonable,<a id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656"
class="fnanchor">[656]</a> but he does not specify any distinguished
individuals as having fallen.</p>

<p>But the Persians, though thus defeated and compelled to abandon
the position of Marathon, were not yet disposed to relinquish
altogether their chances against Attica. Their fleet was observed
to take the direction of Cape Sunium,—a portion being sent to
take up the Eretrian prisoners and the stores which had been left
in the island of Ægilia. At the same time a shield, discernible
from its polished surface afar off, was seen held aloft upon some
high point of Attica,<a id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657"
class="fnanchor">[657]</a>—perhaps on the summit of Mount Pentelikus,
as Colonel Leake supposes with much plausibility. The Athenians
doubtless saw it as well as the Persians; and Miltiadês did not
fail to put the right interpretation upon it, taken in conjunction
with the course of the departing fleet. The shield was a signal
put up by partisans in the country, to invite the Persians round
to Athens by sea, while the Marathonian army was absent. Miltiadês
saw through the plot, and lost not a moment in returning to Athens.
On the very day of the battle, the Athenian army marched back with
the utmost speed from the precinct of Hêraklês at Marathon to the
precinct of the same god at Kynosarges, close to Athens, which they
reached before the arrival of the Persian fleet.<a id="FNanchor_658"
href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> Datis soon came
off the port<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">[p. 352]</span>
of Phalêrum, but the partisans of Hippias had been dismayed by the
rapid return of the Marathonian army, and he did not therefore find
those aids and facilities which he had anticipated for a fresh
disembarkation in the immediate neighborhood of Athens. Though
too late, however, it seems that he was not much too late: the
Marathonian army had only just completed their forced return-march.
A little less quickness on the part of Miltiadês in deciphering the
treasonable signal and giving the instant order of march,—a little
less energy on the part of the Athenian citizens in superadding a
fatiguing march to a no less fatiguing combat,—and the Persians,
with the partisans of Hippias, might have been found in possession
of Athens. As the facts turned out, Datis, finding at Phalêrum
no friendly movement to encourage him, but, on the contrary, the
unexpected presence of the soldiers who had already vanquished him at
Marathon,—made no attempt again to disembark in Attica, and sailed
away, after a short delay, to the Cyclades.</p>

<p>Thus was Athens rescued, for this time at least, from a danger
not less terrible than imminent. Nothing could have rescued her
except that decisive and instantaneous attack which Miltiadês so
emphatically urged. The running step on the field of Marathon might
cause some disorder in the ranks of the hoplites; but extreme
haste in bringing on the combat was the only means of preventing
disunion and distraction in the minds of the citizens. Imperfect
as the account is which Herodotus gives of this most interesting
crisis, we see plainly that the partisans of Hippias had actually
organized a conspiracy, and that it only failed by coming a little
too late. The bright shield uplifted on Mount Pentelikus, apprizing
the Persians that matters were prepared for them at Athens, was
intended to have come to their view before any action had taken
place at Marathon, and while the Athenian army were yet detained
there; so that Datis might have sent a portion of his fleet round
to Phalêrum, retaining the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[p.
353]</span> rest for combat with the enemy before him. If it had
once become known to the Marathonian army that a Persian detachment
had landed at Phalêrum,<a id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659"
class="fnanchor">[659]</a>—where there was a good plain for cavalry
to act in, prior to the building of the Phalêric wall, as had been
seen in the defeat of the Spartan Anchimolius by the Thessalian
cavalry, in 510 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,—that it had been joined by
timid or treacherous Athenians, and had perhaps even got possession
of the city,—their minds would have been so distracted by the
double danger, and by fears for their absent wives and children,
that they would have been disqualified for any unanimous execution
of military orders, and generals as well as soldiers would have
become incurably divided in opinion,—perhaps even mistrustful of
each other. The citizen-soldier of Greece generally, and especially
of Athens, possessed in a high degree both personal bravery and
attachment to order and discipline; but his bravery was not of that
equal, imperturbable, uninquiring character, which belonged to
the battalions of Wellington or Napoleon,—it was fitful, exalted
or depressed by casual occurrences, and often more sensitive to
dangers absent and unseen, than to enemies immediately in his front.
Hence the advantage, so unspeakable in the case before us, and so
well appreciated by Miltiadês, of having one undivided Athenian
army,—with one hostile army, and only one, to meet in the field.
When we come to the battle of Salamis, ten years later, it will be
seen that the Greeks of that day enjoyed the same advantage: though
the wisest advisers of Xerxês impressed upon him the prudence of
dividing his large force, and of sending detachments to assail
separate Greek states—which would infallibly produce the effect of
breaking up the combined Grecian host, and leaving no central or
coöperating force for the defence of Greece generally. Fortunately
for the Greeks, the childish insolence of Xerxês led him to despise
all such advice, as implying conscious weakness. Not so Datis and
Hippias. Sensible of the prudence of distracting the attention of
the Athenians by a double attack, they laid a scheme, while the
main army was at Marathon, for rallying the partisans of Hippias,
with a force to assist them, in the neighborhood of Athens,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[p. 354]</span>—and the signal was
upheld by these partisans as soon as their measures were taken. But
the rapidity of Miltiadês so precipitated the battle, that this
signal came too late, and was only given, “when the Persians were
already in their ships,”<a id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660"
class="fnanchor">[660]</a> after the Marathonian defeat. Even then
it might have proved dangerous, had not the movements of Miltiadês
been as rapid after the victory as before it: but if time had been
allowed for the Persian movement on Athens before the battle of
Marathon had been fought, the triumph of the Athenians might well
have been exchanged for a calamitous servitude. To Miltiadês belongs
the credit of having comprehended the emergency from the beginning,
and overruled the irresolution of his colleagues by his own
single-hearted energy. The chances all turned out in his favor,—for
the unexpected junction of the Platæans in the very encampment
of Marathon must have wrought up the courage of his army to the
highest pitch: and not only did he thus escape all the depressing
and distracting accidents, but he was fortunate enough to find this
extraneous encouragement immediately preceding the battle, from a
source on which he could not have calculated.</p>

<p>I have already observed that the phase of Grecian history best
known to us, amidst which the great authors from whom we draw our
information lived, was one of contempt for the Persians in the
field. And it requires some effort of imagination to call back
previous feelings after the circumstances have been altogether
reversed: perhaps even Æschylus the poet, at the time when he
composed his tragedy of the Persæ, to celebrate the disgraceful
flight of the invader Xerxês, may have forgotten the emotions with
which he and his brother Kynegeirus must have marched out from
Athens fifteen years before, on the eve of the battle of Marathon.
It must therefore be again mentioned that, down to the time when
Datis landed in the bay of Marathon, the tide of Persian success
had never yet been interrupted,—and that especially during the ten
years immediately preceding, the high-handed and cruel extinction
of the Ionic revolt had aggravated to the highest pitch the alarm
of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[p. 355]</span> Greeks.
To this must be added the successes of Datis himself, and the
calamities of Eretria, coming with all the freshness of novelty
as an apparent sentence of death to Athens. The extreme effort of
courage required in the Athenians, to encounter such invaders, is
attested by the division of opinion among the ten generals. Putting
all the circumstances together, it is without a parallel in Grecian
history, surpassing even the combat of Thermopylæ, as will appear
when I come to describe that memorable event. And the admirable
conduct of the five dissentient generals, when outvoted by the
decision of the polemarch against them, in coöperating heartily for
the success of a policy which they deprecated,—proves how much the
feelings of a constitutional democracy, and that entire acceptance
of the pronounced decision of the majority on which it rests, had
worked themselves into the Athenian mind. The combat of Marathon
was by no means a very decisive defeat, but it was a defeat,—and
the first which the Persians had ever received from Greeks in the
field. If the battle of Salamis, ten years afterwards, could be
treated by Themistoklês as a hair-breadth escape for Greece, much
more is this true of the battle of Marathon;<a id="FNanchor_661"
href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> which first afforded
reasonable proof, even to discerning and resolute Greeks, that the
Persians might be effectually repelled, and the independence of
European Greece maintained against them,—a conviction of incalculable
value in reference to the formidable trials destined to follow.
Upon the Athenians themselves, the first to face in the field
successfully the terrific look of a Persian army, the effect of the
victory was yet more stirring and profound.<a id="FNanchor_662"
href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> It supplied them with
resolution for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[p. 356]</span>
the far greater actual sacrifices which they cheerfully underwent
ten years afterwards, at the invasion of Xerxês, without faltering
in their Pan-Hellenic fidelity; and it strengthened them at home by
swelling the tide of common sentiment and patriotic fraternity in the
bosom of every individual citizen. It was the exploit of Athenians
alone, but of all Athenians without dissent or exception,—the boast
of orators, repeated until it almost degenerated into common-place,
though the people seem never to have become weary of allusions to
their single-handed victory over a host of forty-six nations.<a
id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a>
It had been purchased without a drop of intestine bloodshed,—for
even the unknown traitors who raised the signal-shield on Mount
Pentelikus, took care not to betray themselves by want of apparent
sympathy with the triumph: lastly, it was the final guarantee of
their democracy, barring all chance of restoration of Hippias for
the future. Themistoklês<a id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664"
class="fnanchor">[664]</a> is said to have been robbed of his
sleep by the trophies of Miltiadês, and this is cited in proof of
his ambitious temperament; but without supposing either jealousy
or personal love of glory, the rapid transit from extreme danger
to unparalleled triumph might well deprive of rest even the most
sober-minded Athenian.</p>

<p>Who it was that raised the treacherous signal-shield to attract
the Persians to Athens was never ascertained: very probably, in
the full exultation of success, no investigation was made. Of
course, however, the public belief would not be satisfied without
singling out some persons as the authors of such a treason; and the
information received by Herodotus (probably about 450-440 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, forty or fifty years after the Marathonian victory)
ascribed the deed to the Alkmæônids; nor does he notice any other
reported authors, though he rejects the allegation against them
upon very sufficient grounds. They were a race religiously<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[p. 357]</span> tainted, ever since
the Kylonian sacrilege, and were therefore convenient persons to
brand with the odium of an anonymous crime; while party feud, if it
did not originally invent, would at least be active in spreading and
certifying such rumors. At the time when Herodotus knew Athens, the
political enmity between Periklês son of Xanthippus, and Kimon son
of Miltiadês, was at its height: Periklês belonged by his mother’s
side to the Alkmæônid race, and we know that such lineage was made
subservient to political manœuvres against him by his enemies.<a
id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a>
Moreover, the enmity between Kimon and Periklês had been inherited by
both from their fathers; for we shall find Xanthippus, not long after
the battle of Marathon, the prominent accuser of Miltiadês. Though
Xanthippus was not an Alkmæônid, his marriage with Agaristê connected
himself indirectly, and his son Periklês directly, with that race.
And we may trace in this standing political feud a probable origin
for the false reports as to the treason of the Alkmæônids, on that
great occasion which founded the glory of Miltiadês; for that
the reports were false, the intrinsic probabilities of the case,
supported by the judgment of Herodotus, afford ample ground for
believing.</p>

<p>When the Athenian army made its sudden return-march from
Marathon to Athens, Aristeidês with his tribe was left to guard
the field and the spoil; but the speedy retirement of Datis
from Attica left the Athenians at full liberty to revisit the
scene and discharge the last duties to the dead. A tumulus was
erected on the spot<a id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666"
class="fnanchor">[666]</a>—such distinction was never conferred by
Athens except in this case only—to the one hundred and ninety-two
Athenian citizens who had been slain. Their names were inscribed on
ten pillars erected at the spot, one for each tribe: there was also
a second tumulus for the slain Platæans, a third for the slaves,
and a separate funeral monument to Miltiadês himself. Six hundred
years after the battle, Pausanias saw the tumulus, and could still
read on the pillars the names of the immortalized warriors;<a
id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a>
and even now a conspicuous tumulus exists about half a mile from the
sea-shore, which Colonel Leake believes to<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_358">[p. 358]</span> be the same.<a id="FNanchor_668"
href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> The inhabitants of
the deme of Marathon worshipped these slain warriors as heroes, along
with their own eponymus, and with Hêraklês.</p>

<p>So splendid a victory had not been achieved, in the belief of the
Athenians, without marked supernatural aid. The god Pan had met the
courier Pheidippidês on his hasty route from Athens to Sparta, and
had told him that he was much hurt that the Athenians had as yet
neglected to worship him;<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669"
class="fnanchor">[669]</a> in spite of which neglect, however,
he promised them effective aid at Marathon. The promise was
faithfully executed, and the Athenians repaid it by a temple with
annual worship and sacrifice. Moreover, the hero Theseus was seen
strenuously assisting in the battle; and an unknown warrior, in
rustic garb and armed only with a ploughshare, dealt destruction
among the Persian ranks: after the battle he could not be found;
and the Athenians, on asking at Delphi who he was, were directed to
worship the hero Echetlus.<a id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670"
class="fnanchor">[670]</a> Even in the time of Pausanias, this
memorable battle-field was heard to resound every night with the
noise of combatants and the snorting of horses. “It is dangerous
(observes that pious author) to go to the spot with the express
purpose of seeing what is passing; but if a man finds himself there
by accident, without having heard anything about the matter, the gods
will not be angry with him.” The gods, it seems, could not pardon the
inquisitive mortal who deliberately pried into their secrets. Amidst
the ornaments with which Athens was decorated during the free working
of her democracy, the glories of Marathon of course occupied a
conspicuous place. The battle was painted on one of the compartments
of the portico called Pœkilê, wherein, amidst several figures of
gods and heroes,—Athênê, Hêraklês, Theseus, Echetlus, and the local
patron of Marathon,—were seen honored and prominent the polemarch
Kallimachus and the general Miltiadês, while the Platæans were
distinguished by their Bœotian leather casques.<a id="FNanchor_671"
href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> And the sixth of the
month Boëdro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">[p. 359]</span>mion,
the anniversary of the battle, was commemorated by an annual
ceremony, even down to the time of Plutarch.<a id="FNanchor_672"
href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[p. 360]</span>Two thousand
Spartans, starting from their city, immediately after the full moon,
reached the frontier of Attica, on the third<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_361">[p. 361]</span> day of their march,—a surprising
effort, when we consider that the total distance from Sparta to
Athens was about one hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[p.
362]</span> and fifty miles. They did not arrive, however, until the
battle had been fought, and the Persians departed; but curiosity
led them to the field of Marathon to behold the dead bodies of the
Persians, after which they returned home, bestowing well-merited
praise on the victors.</p>

<p>Datis and Artaphernês returned across the Ægean with their
Eretrian prisoners to Asia; stopping for a short time at the island
of Mykonos, where discovery was made of a gilt image of Apollo
carried off as booty in a Phenician ship. Datis went himself to
restore it to Dêlos, requesting the Delians to carry it back to the
Delium, or temple of Apollo, on the eastern coast of Bœotia: the
Delians, however, chose to keep the statue until it was reclaimed
from them twenty years afterwards by the Thebans. On reaching Asia,
the Persian generals conducted their prisoners up to the court of
Susa, and into the presence of Darius. Though he had been vehemently
incensed against them, yet when he saw them in his power, his wrath
abated, and he manifested no desire to kill or harm them. They were
planted at a spot called Arderikka, in the Kissian territory, one
of the resting-places on the road from Sardis to Susa, and about
twenty-six miles distant from the latter place: Herodotus seems
himself to have seen their descendants there on his journey between
the two capitals,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[p. 363]</span>
and to have had the satisfaction of talking to them in Greek,—which
we may well conceive to have made some impression upon him, at a spot
distant by nearly three months’ journey from the coast of Ionia.<a
id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a></p>

<p>Happy would it have been for Miltiadês if he had shared the
honorable death of the polemarch Kallimachus,—“animam exhalasset
opimam,”—in seeking to fire the ships of the defeated Persians at
Marathon. The short sequel of his history will be found in melancholy
contrast with the Marathonian heroism.</p>

<p>His reputation had been great before the battle, and after it
the admiration and confidence of his countrymen knew no bounds:
it appears, indeed, to have reached such a pitch that his head
was turned, and he lost both his patriotism and his prudence. He
proposed to his countrymen to incur the cost of equipping an armament
of seventy ships, with an adequate armed force, and to place it
altogether at his discretion; giving them no intimation whither
he intended to go, but merely assuring them that, if they would
follow him, he would conduct them to a land where gold was abundant,
and thus enrich them. Such a promise, from the lips of the recent
victor of Marathon, was sufficient, and the armament was granted,
no man except Miltiadês knowing what was its destination. He sailed
immediately to the island of Paros, laid siege to the town, and sent
in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[p. 364]</span> herald to
require from the inhabitants a contribution of one hundred talents,
on pain of entire destruction. His pretence for this attack was,
that the Parians had furnished a trireme to Datis for the Persian
fleet at Marathon; but his real motive, so Herodotus assures us,<a
id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a>
was vindictive animosity against a Parian citizen named Lysagoras,
who had exasperated the Persian general Hydarnês against him. The
Parians amused him at first with evasions, until they had procured a
little delay to repair the defective portions of their wall, after
which they set him at defiance; and Miltiadês in vain prosecuted
hostilities against them for the space of twenty-six days: he ravaged
the island, but his attacks made no impression upon the town.<a
id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a>
Beginning to despair of success in his military operations, he
entered into some negotiation—such at least was the tale of the
Parians themselves—with a Parian woman named Timô, priestess or
attendant in the temple of Dêmêtêr, near the town-gates. This woman,
promising to reveal to him a secret which would place Paros in his
power, induced him to visit by night a temple to which no male person
was admissible. He leaped the exterior fence, and approached the
sanctuary; but on coming near, was seized with a panic terror and
ran away, almost out of his senses: on leaping the same fence to get
back, he strained or bruised his thigh badly, and became utterly
disabled. In this melancholy state he was placed on ship-board; the
siege being raised, and the whole armament returning to Athens.</p>

<p>Vehement was the indignation both of the armament and of
the remaining Athenians against Miltiadês on his return;<a
id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a>
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[p. 365]</span> Xanthippus,
father of the great Periklês, became the spokesman of this feeling.
He impeached Miltiadês before the popular judicature as having been
guilty of deceiving the people, and as having deserved the penalty of
death. The accused himself, disabled by his injured thigh, which even
began to show symptoms of gangrene, was unable to stand, or to say
a word in his own defence: he lay on his couch before the assembled
judges, while his friends made the best case they could in his
behalf. Defence, it appears, there was none; all they could do, was
to appeal to his previous services: they reminded the people largely
and emphatically of the inestimable exploit of Marathon, coming in
addition to his previous conquest of Lemnos. The assembled dikasts,
or jurors, showed their sense of these powerful appeals by rejecting
the proposition of his accuser to condemn him to death; but they
imposed on him the penalty of fifty talents “for his iniquity.”</p>

<p>Cornelius Nepos affirms that these fifty talents represented the
expenses incurred by the state in fitting out the armament; but we
may more probably believe, looking to the practice of the Athenian
dikastery in criminal cases, that fifty talents was the<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[p. 366]</span> minor penalty actually
proposed by the defenders of Miltiadês themselves, as a substitute
for the punishment of death. In those penal cases at Athens, where
the punishment was not fixed beforehand by the terms of the law,
if the person accused was found guilty, it was customary to submit
to the jurors, subsequently and separately, the question as to
amount of punishment: first, the accuser named the penalty which he
thought suitable; next, the accused person was called upon to name
an amount of penalty for himself, and the jurors were constrained
to take their choice between these two,—no third gradation of
penalty being admissible for consideration.<a id="FNanchor_677"
href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> Of course, under such
circum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[p. 367]</span>stances, it
was the interest of the accused party to name, even in his own case,
some real and serious penalty,—something which the jurors might be
likely to deem not wholly inadequate to his crime just proved; for
if he proposed some penalty only trifling, he drove them to prefer
the heavier sentence recommended by his opponent. Accordingly, in
the case of Miltiadês, his friends, desirous of inducing the jurors
to refuse their assent to the punishment of death, proposed a fine
of fifty talents as the self-assessed penalty of the defendant;
and perhaps they may have stated, as an argument in the case, that
such a sum would suffice to defray the costs of the expedition. The
fine was imposed, but Miltiadês did not live to pay it; his injured
limb mortified, and he died, leaving the fine to be paid by his son
Kimon.</p>

<p>According to Cornelius Nepos, Diodorus, and Plutarch, he
was put in prison, after having been fined, and there died.<a
id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a>
But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[p. 368]</span> Herodotus
does not mention this imprisonment, and the fact appears to me
improbable: he would hardly have omitted to notice it, had it come
to his knowledge. Immediate imprisonment of a person fined by
the dikastery, until his fine was paid, was not the natural and
ordinary course of Athenian procedure, though there were particular
cases in which such aggravation was added. Usually, a certain time
was allowed for payment,<a id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679"
class="fnanchor">[679]</a> before absolute execution was resorted
to, but the person under sentence became disfranchised and excluded
from all political rights, from the very instant of his condemnation
as a public debtor, until the fine was paid. Now in the instance
of Miltiadês, the lamentable condition of his wounded thigh
rendered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">[p. 369]</span> escape
impossible,—so that there would be no special motive for departing
from the usual practice, and imprisoning him forthwith: moreover,
if he was not imprisoned forthwith, he would not be imprisoned
at all, since he cannot have lived many days after his trial.<a
id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> To
carry away the suffering general in his couch, incapable of raising
himself even to plead for his own life, from the presence of the
dikasts to a prison, would not only have been a needless severity,
but could hardly have failed to imprint itself on the sympathies and
the memory of all the beholders; so that Herodotus would have been
likely to hear and mention it, if it had really occurred. I incline
to believe therefore that Miltiadês died at home: all accounts
concur in stating that he died of the mortal bodily hurt which
already disabled him even at the moment of his trial, and that his
son Kimon paid the fifty talents after his death. If <i>he</i> could pay
them, probably his father could have paid them also. And this is an
additional reason for believing that there was no imprisonment,—for
nothing but non-payment could have sent him to prison; and to rescue
the suffering Miltiadês from being sent thither, would have been the
first and strongest desire of all sympathizing friends.</p>

<p>Thus closed the life of the conqueror of Marathon. The last act
of it produces an impression so mournful, and even shocking,—his
descent from the pinnacle of glory to defeat, mean tampering with a
temple-servant, mortal bodily hurt, undefended ignominy, and death
under a sentence of heavy fine, is so abrupt and unprepared,—that
readers, ancient and modern, have not been satisfied without
finding some one to blame for it: we must except Herodotus, our
original authority, who recounts the transaction without dropping
a single hint of blame against any one. To speak ill of the
people, as Machiavel has long ago observed,<a id="FNanchor_681"
href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> is a strain in
which every one at all times, even under a democratical government,
indulges with impunity and without provok<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_370">[p. 370]</span>ing any opponent to reply; and in this
instance, the hard fate of Miltiadês has been imputed to the vices of
the Athenians and their democracy,—it has been cited in proof, partly
of their fickleness, partly of their ingratitude. But however such
blame may serve to lighten the mental sadness arising from a series
of painful facts, it will not be found justified if we apply to those
facts a reasonable criticism.</p>

<p>What is called the fickleness of the Athenians on this occasion is
nothing more than a rapid and decisive change in their estimation of
Miltiadês; unbounded admiration passing at once into extreme wrath.
To censure them for fickleness is here an abuse of terms; such a
change in their opinion was the unavoidable result of his conduct.
His behavior in the expedition of Paros was as reprehensible as at
Marathon it had been meritorious, and the one succeeded immediately
after the other: what else could ensue except an entire revolution in
the Athenian feelings? He had employed his prodigious ascendency over
their minds to induce them to follow him without knowing whither,
in the confidence of an unknown booty: he had exposed their lives
and wasted their substance in wreaking a private grudge: in addition
to the shame of an unprincipled project, comes the constructive
shame of not having succeeded in it. Without doubt, such behavior,
coming from a man whom they admired to excess, must have produced
a violent and painful revulsion in the feelings of his countrymen.
The idea of having lavished praise and confidence upon a person who
forthwith turns it to an unworthy purpose, is one of the greatest
torments of the human bosom; and we may well understand that the
intensity of the subsequent displeasure would be aggravated by this
reactionary sentiment, without accusing the Athenians of fickleness.
If an officer, whose conduct has been such as to merit the highest
encomiums, comes on a sudden to betray his trust, and manifests
cowardice or treachery in a new and important undertaking confided
to him, are we to treat the general in command as fickle, because
his opinion as well as his conduct undergoes an instantaneous
revolution,—which will be all the more vehement in proportion to his
previous esteem? The question to be determined is, whether there be
sufficient ground for such a change; and in the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_371">[p. 371]</span> case of Miltiadês, that question must
be answered in the affirmative.</p>

<p>In regard to the charge of ingratitude against the Athenians, this
last-mentioned point—sufficiency of reason—stands tacitly admitted.
It is conceded that Miltiadês deserved punishment for his conduct in
reference to the Parian expedition, but it is nevertheless maintained
that gratitude for his previous services at Marathon ought to have
exempted him from punishment. But the sentiment upon which, after
all, this exculpation rests, will not bear to be drawn out and stated
in the form of a cogent or justifying reason. For will any one really
contend, that a man who has rendered great services to the public,
is to receive in return a license of unpunished misconduct for the
future? Is the general, who has earned applause by eminent skill and
important victories, to be recompensed by being allowed the liberty
of betraying his trust afterwards, and exposing his country to peril,
without censure or penalty? This is what no one intends to vindicate
deliberately; yet a man must be prepared to vindicate it, when he
blames the Athenians for ingratitude towards Miltiadês. For if all
that be meant is, that gratitude for previous services ought to pass,
not as a receipt in full for subsequent crime, but as an extenuating
circumstance in the measurement of the penalty, the answer is,
that it was so reckoned in the Athenian treatment of Miltiadês.<a
id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> His
friends had nothing whatever to urge, against<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_372">[p. 372]</span> the extreme penalty proposed by his
accuser, except these previous services,—which influenced the dikasts
sufficiently to induce them to inflict the lighter punishment
instead of the heavier. Now the whole amount of punishment inflicted
consisted in a fine which certainly was not beyond his reasonable
means of paying, or of prevailing upon friends to pay for him, since
his son Kimon actually did pay it. And those who blame the Athenians
for ingratitude,—unless they are prepared to maintain the doctrine
that previous services are to pass as full acquittal for future
crime,—have no other ground left except to say that the fine was too
high; that instead of being fifty talents, it ought to have been no
more than forty, thirty, twenty, or ten talents. Whether they are
right in this, I will not take upon me to pronounce. If the amount
was named on behalf of the accused party, the dikastery had no legal
power of diminishing it; but it is within such narrow limits that
the question actually lies, when transferred from the province of
sentiment to that of reason. It will be recollected that the death
of Miltiadês arose neither from his trial nor his fine, but from the
hurt in his thigh.</p>

<p>The charge of ingratitude against the Athenian popular juries
really amounts to this,—that, in trying a person accused of present
crime or fault, they were apt to confine themselves too strictly and
exclusively to the particular matter of charge, either forgetting,
or making too little account of, past services which he might have
rendered. Whoever imagines that such was the habit of Athenian
dikasts, must have studied the orators to very little purpose. Their
real defect was the very opposite: they were too much disposed
to wander from the special issue before them, and to be affected
by appeals to previous services and con<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_373">[p. 373]</span>duct.<a id="FNanchor_683"
href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> That which an accused
person at Athens usually strives to produce is, an impression in the
minds of the dikasts favorable to his general character and behavior.
Of course, he meets the particular allegation of his accuser as well
as he can, but he never fails also to remind them emphatically, how
well he has performed his general duties of a citizen,—how many times
he has served in military expeditions,—how many trierarchies and
liturgies he has performed, and performed with splendid efficiency.
In fact, the claim of an accused person to acquittal is made to
rest too much on his prior services, and too little upon innocence
or justifying matter as to the particular indictment. When we come
down to the time of the orators, I shall be prepared to show that
such indisposition to confine themselves to a special issue was one
of the most serious defects of the assembled dikasts at Athens. It
is one which we should naturally expect from a body of private,
non-professional citizens assembled for the occasion, and which
belongs more or less to the system of jury-trial everywhere; but it
is the direct reverse of that ingratitude, or habitual insensibility
to prior services, for which they have been so often denounced.</p>

<p>The fate of Miltiadês, then, so far from illustrating either
the fickleness or the ingratitude of his countrymen, attests their
just appreciation of deserts. It also illustrates another moral, of
no small importance to the right comprehension of Grecian affairs;
it teaches us the painful lesson, how perfectly maddening were
the effects of a copious draught of glory on the temperament of
an enterprising and ambitious Greek. There can be no doubt,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[p. 374]</span> that the rapid
transition, in the course of about one week, from Athenian terror
before the battle to Athenian exultation after it, must have
produced demonstrations towards Miltiadês such as were never paid
towards any other man in the whole history of the commonwealth.
Such unmeasured admiration unseated his rational judgment, so that
his mind became abandoned to the reckless impulses of insolence,
and antipathy, and rapacity;—that distempered state, for which
(according to Grecian morality) the retributive Nemesis was ever
on the watch, and which, in his case, she visited with a judgment
startling in its rapidity, as well as terrible in its amount. Had
Miltiadês been the same man before the battle of Marathon as he
became after it, the battle might probably have turned out a defeat
instead of a victory. Dêmosthenês, indeed,<a id="FNanchor_684"
href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> in speaking of the
wealth and luxury of political leaders in his own time, and the
profuse rewards bestowed upon them by the people, pointed in contrast
to the house of Miltiadês as being noway more splendid than that of a
private man. But though Miltiadês might continue to live in a modest
establishment, he received from his countrymen marks of admiration
and deference such as were never paid to any citizen before or after
him; and, after all, admiration and deference constitute the precious
essence of popular reward. No man except Miltiadês ever dared to
raise his voice in the Athenian assembly, and say: “Give me a fleet
of ships: do not ask what I am going to do with them, but only
follow me, and I will enrich you.” Herein we may read the unmeasured
confidence which the Athenians placed in their victorious general,
and the utter incapacity of a leading Greek to bear it without mental
depravation; while we learn from it to draw the melancholy inference,
that one result of success was to make the successful leader one
of the most dangerous men in the community. We shall presently be
called upon to observe the same tendency in the case of the Spartan
Pausanias, and even in that of the Athenian Themistoklês. It is,
indeed, fortunate that the reckless aspirations of Miltiadês did not
take a turn more noxious to Athens than the comparatively unimportant
enterprise against Paros. For had he sought to acquire dominion
and gratify antipathies against enemies at<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_375">[p. 375]</span> home, instead of directing his blow
against a Parian enemy, the peace and security of his country might
have been seriously endangered.</p>

<p>Of the despots who gained power in Greece, a considerable
proportion began by popular conduct, and by rendering good service
to their fellow-citizens: having first earned public gratitude, they
abused it for purposes of their own ambition. There was far greater
danger, in a Grecian community, of dangerous excess of gratitude
towards a victorious soldier, than of deficiency in that sentiment:
hence the person thus exalted acquired a position such that the
community found it difficult afterwards to shake him off. Now there
is a disposition almost universal among writers and readers to side
with an individual, especially an eminent individual, against the
multitude; and accordingly those who under such circumstances suspect
the probable abuse of an exalted position, are denounced as if they
harbored an unworthy jealousy of superior abilities. But the truth
is, that the largest analogies of the Grecian character justified
that suspicion, and required the community to take precautions
against the corrupting effects of their own enthusiasm. There is
no feature which more largely pervades the impressible Grecian
character, than a liability to be intoxicated and demoralized by
success: there was no fault from which so few eminent Greeks were
free: there was hardly any danger, against which it was at once
so necessary and so difficult for the Grecian governments to take
security,—especially the democracies, where the manifestations of
enthusiasm were always the loudest. Such is the real explanation of
those charges which have been urged against the Grecian democracies,
that they came to hate and ill-treat previous benefactors; and the
history of Miltiadês illustrates it in a manner no less pointed than
painful.</p>

<p>I have already remarked that the fickleness, which has been so
largely imputed to the Athenian democracy in their dealings with
him, is nothing more than a reasonable change of opinion on the
best grounds. Nor can it be said that fickleness was in any case
an attribute of the Athenian democracy. It is a well-known fact,
that feelings, or opinions, or modes of judging, which have once
obtained footing among a large number of people, are more lasting and
unchangeable than those which belong only to<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_376">[p. 376]</span> one or a few; insomuch that the
judgments and actions of the many admit of being more clearly
understood as to the past, and more certainly predicted as to the
future. If we are to predicate any attribute of the multitude, it
will rather be that of undue tenacity than undue fickleness; and
there will occur nothing in the course of this history to prove
that the Athenian people changed their opinions on insufficient
grounds more frequently than an unresponsible one or few would have
changed.</p>

<p>But there were two circumstances in the working of the Athenian
democracy which imparted to it an appearance of greater fickleness,
without the reality: First, that the manifestations and changes
of opinion were all open, undisguised, and noisy: the people gave
utterance to their present impression, whatever it was, with perfect
frankness; if their opinions were really changed, they had no shame
or scruple in avowing it. Secondly,—and this is a point of capital
importance in the working of democracy generally,—the <i>present</i>
impression, whatever it might be, was not merely undisguised in
its manifestations, but also had a tendency to be exaggerated in
its intensity. This arose from their habit of treating public
affairs in multitudinous assemblages, the well-known effect of
which is, to inflame sentiment in every man’s bosom by mere contact
with a sympathizing circle of neighbors. Whatever the sentiment
might be,—fear, ambition, cupidity, wrath, compassion, piety,
patriotic devotion, etc,<a id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685"
class="fnanchor">[685]</a>—and whether well-founded or ill-founded,
it was constantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[p. 377]</span>
influenced more or less by such intensifying cause. This is a
defect which of course belongs in a certain degree to all exercise
of power by numerous bodies, even though they be representative
bodies,—especially when the character of the people, instead of being
comparatively sedate and slow to move, like the English, is quick,
impressible, and fiery, like Greeks or Italians; but it operated
far more powerfully on the self-acting Dêmos assembled in the Pnyx.
It was in fact the constitutional malady of the democracy, of which
the people were themselves perfectly sensible,—as I shall show
hereafter from the securities which they tried to provide against
it,—but which no securities could ever wholly eradicate. Frequency
of public assemblies, far from aggravating the evil, had a tendency
to lighten it. The people thus became accustomed to hear and balance
many different views as a preliminary to ultimate judgment; they
contracted personal interest and esteem for a numerous class of
dissentient speakers; and they even acquired a certain practical
consciousness of their own liability to error. Moreover, the
diffusion of habits of public speaking, by means of the sophists and
the rhetors, whom it has been so much the custom to disparage, tended
in the same direction,—to break the unity of sentiment among the
listening crowd, to multiply separate judgments, and to neutralize
the contagion of mere sympathizing impulse. These were important
deductions, still farther assisted by the superior taste and
intelligence of the Athenian people: but still, the inherent malady
remained,—excessive and misleading intensity of present sentiment.
It was this which gave such inestimable value to the ascendency of
Periklês, as depicted by Thucydidês: his hold on the people was so
firm, that he could always speak with effect against excess of the
reigning tone of feeling. “When Periklês (says the historian) saw the
people in a state of unseasonable and insolent confidence, he spoke
so as to cow them into alarm; when again they were in groundless
terror, he combated it, and brought them back to confidence.”<a
id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a>
We shall find Dêmosthenês,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[p.
378]</span> with far inferior ascendency, employed in the same
honorable task: the Athenian people often stood in need of such
correction, but unfortunately did not always find statesmen, at once
friendly and commanding, to administer it.</p>

<p>These two attributes, then, belonged to the Athenian democracy;
first, their sentiments of every kind were manifested loudly and
openly; next, their sentiments tended to a pitch of great present
intensity. Of course, therefore, when they changed, the change
of sentiment stood prominent, and forced itself upon every one’s
notice,—being a transition from one strong sentiment past to another
strong sentiment present.<a id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687"
class="fnanchor">[687]</a> And it was because such alterations,
when they did take place, stood out so palpably to remark, that
the Athenian people have drawn upon themselves the imputation of
fickleness: for it is not at all true, I repeat, that changes
of sentiment were more frequently produced in them by frivolous
or insufficient causes, than changes of sentiment in other
governments.</p>

    IONIC PHILOSOPHERS. — PYTHAGORAS. — KROTON AND SYBARIS.</h2>
</div>

<p class="mt1"><span class="smcap">The</span> history of the
powerful Grecian cities in Italy and Sicily, between the accession
of Peisistratus and the battle of Marathon, is for the most part
unknown to us. Phalaris, despot of Agrigentum in Sicily, made
for himself an unenviable name during this obscure interval. His
reign seems to coincide in time with the earlier part of the
rule of Peisistratus (about 560-540 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>),<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[p. 379]</span> and the few and
vague statements which we find respecting it,<a id="FNanchor_688"
href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a> merely show us that
it was a period of extortion and cruelty, even beyond the ordinary
licence of Grecian despots. The reality of the hollow bull of brass,
which Phalaris was accustomed to heat in order to shut up his victims
in it and burn them, appears to be better authenticated than the
nature of the story would lead us to presume: for it is not only
noticed by Pindar, but even the actual instrument of this torture,
the brazen bull itself,<a id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689"
class="fnanchor">[689]</a>—which had been taken away from Agrigentum
as a trophy by the Carthaginians when they captured the town, was
restored by the Romans, on the subjugation of Carthage, to its
original domicile. Phalaris is said to have acquired the supreme
command, by undertaking the task of building a great temple<a
id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> to
Zeus Polieus on the citadel rock; a pretence whereby he was enabled
to assemble and arm a number of workmen and devoted partisans, whom
he employed, at the festival of the Thesmophoria, to put down the
authorities. He afterwards disarmed the citizens by a stratagem,
and committed cruelties which rendered him so abhorred, that a
sudden rising of the people, headed by Têlemachus (ancestor of the
subsequent despot, Thêro), overthrew and<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_380">[p. 380]</span> slew him. A severe revenge was
taken on his partisans after his fall.<a id="FNanchor_691"
href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a></p>

<p>During the interval between 540-500 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, events
of much importance occurred among the Italian Greeks,—especially at
Kroton and Sybaris,—events, unhappily, very imperfectly handed down.
Between these two periods fall both the war between Sybaris and
Kroton, and the career and ascendency of Pythagoras. In connection
with this latter name, it will be requisite to say a few words
respecting the other Grecian philosophers of the sixth century
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small></p>

<p>I have, in a former chapter, noticed and characterized those
distinguished persons called the Seven Wise Men of Greece, whose
celebrity falls in the first half of this century,—men not so much
marked by scientific genius as by practical sagacity and foresight
in the appreciation of worldly affairs, and enjoying a high degree
of political respect from their fellow-citizens. One of them,
however, the Milesian Thalês, claims our notice, not only on this
ground, but also as the earliest known name in the long line of Greek
scientific investigators. His life, nearly contemporary with that
of Solon, belongs seemingly to the interval about 640-550 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>: the stories mentioned in Herodotus—perhaps borrowed in
part from the Milesian Hekatæus—are sufficient to show that his
reputation for wisdom, as well as for science, continued to be very
great, even a century after his death, among his fellow-citizens.
And he marks an important epoch in the progress of the Greek mind,
as having been the first man to depart both in letter and spirit
from the Hesiodic Theogony, introducing the conception of substances
with their transformations and sequences, in place of that string
of persons and quasi-human attributes which had animated the old
legendary world. He is the father of what is called the Ionic
philosophy, which is considered as lasting from his time down to that
of Sokratês; and writers, ancient as well as modern, have professed
to trace a succession of philosophers, each one the pupil of the
preceding, between these two extreme epochs. But the appellation
is, in truth, undefined, and even incorrect, since nothing
entitled to the name of a school, or sect, or succession,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[p. 381]</span>—like that of the
Pythagoreans, to be noticed presently,—can be made out. There is,
indeed, a certain general analogy in the philosophical vein of
Thalês, Hippo, Anaximenês, and Diogenês of Apollonia, whereby they
all stand distinguished from Xenophanês of Elea, and his successors,
the Eleatic dialecticians, Parmenidês and Zeno; but there are also
material differences between their respective doctrines,—no two of
them holding the same. And if we look to Anaximander, the person next
in order of time to Thalês, as well as to Herakleitus, we find them
departing, in a great degree, even from that character which all the
rest have in common, though both the one and the other are usually
enrolled in the list of Ionic philosophers.</p>

<p>Of the old legendary and polytheistic conception of nature, which
Thalês partially discarded, we may remark that it is a state of the
human mind in which the problems suggesting themselves to be solved,
and the machinery for solving them, bear a fair proportion one to
the other. If the problems be vast, indeterminate, confused, and
derived rather from the hopes, fears, love, hatred, astonishment,
etc., of men, than from any genuine desire of knowledge,—so also
does the received belief supply invisible agents in unlimited
number, and with every variety of power and inclination. The means
of explanation are thus multiplied and diversified as readily as the
phenomena to be explained. And though no future events or states can
be predicted on trustworthy grounds, in such manner as to stand the
scrutiny of subsequent verification,—yet there is little difficulty
in rendering a specious and plausible account of matters past, of any
and all things alike; especially as, at such a period, matters of
fact requiring explanation are neither collated nor preserved with
care. And though no event or state, which has not yet occurred, can
be predicted, there is little difficulty in rendering a plausible
account of everything which has occurred in the past. Cosmogony, and
the prior ages of the world, were conceived as a sort of personal
history, with intermarriages, filiation, quarrels, and other
adventures, of these invisible agents; among whom some one or more
were assumed as unbegotten and self-existent,—the latter assumption
being a difficulty common to all systems of cosmogony, and from which
even this flexible and expansive hypothesis is not exempt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[p. 382]</span>Now when
Thalês disengaged Grecian philosophy from the old mode of
explanation, he did not at the same time disengage it from the old
problems and matters propounded for inquiry. These he retained,
and transmitted to his successors, as vague and vast as they
were at first conceived; and so they remained, though with some
transformations and modifications, together with many new questions
equally insoluble, substantially present to the Greeks throughout
their whole history, as the legitimate problems for philosophical
investigation. But these problems, adapted only to the old elastic
system of polytheistic explanation and omnipresent personal agency,
became utterly disproportioned to any impersonal hypotheses such
as those of Thalês and the philosophers after him,—whether assumed
physical laws, or plausible moral and metaphysical dogmas, open to
argumentative attack, and of course requiring the like defence. To
treat the visible world as a whole, and inquire when and how it
began, as well as into all its past changes,—to discuss the first
origin of men, animals, plants, the sun, the stars, etc.,—to assign
some comprehensive reason why motion or change in general took place
in the universe,—to investigate the destinies of the human race, and
to lay down some systematic relation between them and the gods,—all
these were topics admitting of being conceived in many different
ways, and set forth with eloquent plausibility, but not reducible to
any solution either resting on scientific evidence, or commanding
steady adherence under a free scrutiny.<a id="FNanchor_692"
href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a></p>

<p>At the time when the power of scientific investigation was
scanty and helpless, the problems proposed were thus such as
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[p. 383]</span> lie out of
the reach of science in its largest compass. Gradually, indeed,
subjects more special and limited, and upon which experience, or
deductions from experience, could be brought to bear, were added
to the list of <i>quæsita</i>, and examined with great profit and
instruction: but the old problems, with new ones, alike unfathomable,
were never eliminated, and always occupied a prominent place in
the philosophical world. Now it was this disproportion, between
questions to be solved and means of solution, which gave rise
to that conspicuous characteristic of Grecian philosophy,—the
antagonist force of suspensive skepticism, passing in some minds
into a broad negation of the attainability of general truth,—which
it nourished from its beginning to its end; commencing as early
as Xenophanês, continuing to manifest itself seven centuries
afterwards in Ænesidêmus and Sextus Empiricus, and including in
the interval between these two extremes some of the most powerful
intellects in Greece. The present is not the time for considering
these Skeptics, who bear an unpopular name, and have not often been
fairly appreciated; the more so, as it often suited the purpose of
men, themselves essentially skeptical, like Sokratês and Plato, to
denounce professed skepticism with indignation. But it is essential
to bring them into notice at the first spring of Grecian philosophy
under Thalês, because the circumstances were then laid which so soon
afterwards developed them.</p>

<p>Though the celebrity of Thalês in antiquity was great and
universal, scarcely any distinct facts were known respecting
him: it is certain that he left nothing in writing. Extensive
travels in Egypt and Asia are ascribed to him, and as a general
fact these travels are doubtless true, since no other means of
acquiring knowledge were then open. At a time when the brother
of the Lesbian Alkæus was serving in the Babylonian army, we may
easily conceive that an inquisitive Milesian would make his way
to that wonderful city wherein stood the temple-observatory of
the Chaldæan priesthood; nor is it impossible that he may have
seen the still greater city of Ninus, or Nineveh, before its
capture and destruction by the Medes. How great his reputation
was in his lifetime, the admiration expressed by his younger
contemporary, Xenophanês, assures us; and Herakleitus, in the next
generation, a severe judge of all other<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_384">[p. 384]</span> philosophers, spoke of him with
similar esteem. To him were traced, by the Grecian inquirers of
the fourth century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, the first beginnings
of geometry, astronomy, and physiology in its large and really
appropriate sense, the scientific study of nature: for the Greek
word denoting nature (φύσις), first comes into comprehensive use
about this time (as I have remarked in an earlier chapter),<a
id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a>
with its derivatives <i>physics</i> and <i>physiology</i>, as distinguished
from the <i>theology</i> of the old poets. Little stress can be laid on
those elementary propositions in geometry which are specified as
discovered, or as first demonstrated, by Thalês,—still less upon
the solar eclipse respecting which, according to Herodotus, he
determined beforehand the year of occurrence.<a id="FNanchor_694"
href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> But the main doctrine
of his physiology,—using that word in its larger Greek sense,—is
distinctly attested. He stripped Oceanus and Tethys, primeval parents
of the gods in the Homeric theogony, of their personality,—and laid
down water, or fluid substance, as the single original element
from which everything came, and into which everything returned.<a
id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a>
The doctrine of one eternal element, remaining always the same in
its essence, but indefinitely variable in its manifestations to
sense, was thus first introduced to the discussion of the Grecian
public. We have no means of knowing the reasons by which Thalês
supported this opinion, nor could even Aristotle do more than
conjecture what they might have been; but one of the statements
urged on behalf of it,—that the earth itself rested on water,<a
id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a>—we
may safely refer to the Milesian himself, for it would hardly have
been advanced at a later age. Moreover, Thalês is reported to have
held, that everything was living and full of gods; and that the
magnet, especially, was a living thing. Thus the gods, as far as
we can pretend to follow opinions so very faintly transmitted, are
conceived as active powers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">[p.
385]</span> and causes of changeful manifestation, attached to
the primeval substance:<a id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697"
class="fnanchor">[697]</a> the universe being assimilated to an
organized body or system.</p>

<p>Respecting Hippo,—who reproduced the theory of Thalês under
a more generalized form of expression, substituting, in place
of water, moisture, or something common to air and water,<a
id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a>—we
do not know whether he belonged to the sixth or the fifth century
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> But Anaximander, Xenophanês, and Pherekydês
belong to the latter half of the sixth century. Anaximander,
the son of Praxiadês, was a native of Milêtus,—Xenophanês, a
native of Kolophon; the former, among the earliest expositors
of doctrine in prose,<a id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699"
class="fnanchor">[699]</a> while the latter committed his opinions
to the old medium of verse. Anaximander seems to have taken up the
philosophical problem, while he materially altered the hypothesis of
his predecessor Thalês. Instead of the primeval fluid of the latter,
he supposed a primeval principle, without any actual determining
qualities whatever, but including all qualities potentially, and
manifesting them in an infinite variety from its continually
self-changing nature,—a principle, which was nothing in itself, yet
had the capacity of producing any and all manifestations, however
contrary to each other,<a id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700"
class="fnanchor">[700]</a>—a primeval something, whose essence<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_386">[p. 386]</span> it was to be eternally
productive of different phenomena,—a sort of mathematical point,
which counts for nothing in itself, but is vigorous in generating
lines to any extent that may be desired. In this manner, Anaximander
professed to give a comprehensive explanation of change in
general, or generation, or destruction,—how it happened that one
sensible thing began and another ceased to exist,—according to the
vague problems which these early inquirers were in the habit of
setting to themselves.<a id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701"
class="fnanchor">[701]</a> He avoided that which the first
philosophers especially dreaded, the affirmation that generation
could take place out of Nothing; yet the primeval Something, which he
supposed was only distinguished from nothing by possessing this very
power of generation.</p>

<p>In his theory, he passed from the province of physics into
that of metaphysics. He first introduced into Grecian philosophy
that important word which signifies a beginning or a principle,<a
id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> and
first opened that metaphysical discussion, which was carried on in
various ways throughout the whole period of Grecian philosophy, as
to the one and the many—the continuous and the variable—that which
exists eternally, as distinguished from that which comes and passes
away in ever-changing manifestations. His physiology, or explanation
of nature, thus conducted the mind into a different route from that
suggested by the hypothesis of Thalês, which was built upon physical
considerations, and was therefore calculated to suggest and stimulate
observations of physical phenomena for the purpose of verifying or
confuting it,—while the hypothesis of Anaximander admitted only of
being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">[p. 387]</span> discussed
dialectically, or by reasonings expressed in general language;
reasonings sometimes, indeed, referring to experience for the purpose
of illustration, but seldom resting on it, and never looking out
for it as a necessary support. The physical explanation of nature,
however, once introduced by Thalês, although deserted by Anaximander,
was taken up by Anaximenês and others afterwards, and reproduced
with many divergences of doctrine,—yet always more or less entangled
and perplexed with metaphysical additions, since the two departments
were never clearly parted throughout all Grecian philosophy. Of these
subsequent physical philosophers I shall speak hereafter: at present,
I confine myself to the thinkers of the sixth century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, among whom Anaximander stands prominent, not as the
follower of Thalês, but as the author of an hypothesis both new and
tending in a different direction.</p>

<p>It was not merely as the author of this hypothesis, however,
that Anaximander enlarged the Greek mind and roused the powers of
thought: we find him also mentioned as distinguished in astronomy
and geometry. He is said to have been the first to establish a
sun-dial in Greece, to construct a sphere, and to explain the
obliquity of the ecliptic;<a id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703"
class="fnanchor">[703]</a> how far such alleged authorship really
belongs to him, we cannot be certain,—but there is one step of
immense importance which he is clearly affirmed to have made. He was
the first to compose a treatise on the geography of the land and
sea within his cognizance, and to construct a chart or map founded
thereupon,—seemingly a tablet of brass. Such a novelty, wondrous even
to the rude and ignorant, was calculated to stimulate powerfully
inquisitive minds, and from it may be dated the commencement of
Grecian rational geography,—not the least valuable among the
contributions of this people to the stock of human knowledge.</p>

<p>Xenophanês of Kolophon, somewhat younger than Anaximander, and
nearly contemporary with Pythagoras (seemingly from about 570-480
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), migrated from Kolophon<a id="FNanchor_704"
href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> to Zanklê and
Katana in Sicily and Elea in Italy, soon after the time when<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_388">[p. 388]</span> Ionia became subject
to the Persians, (540-530 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>) He was the founder
of what is called the Eleatic school of philosophers,—a real school,
since it appears that Parmenidês, Zeno, and Melissus, pursued and
developed, in a great degree, the train of speculation which had
been begun by Xenophanês,—doubtless with additions and variations of
their own, but especially with a dialectic power which belongs to
the age of Periklês, and is unknown in the sixth century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> He was the author of more than one poem of considerable
length, one on the foundation of Kolophon and another on that
of Elea; besides his poem on Nature, wherein his philosophical
doctrines were set forth.<a id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705"
class="fnanchor">[705]</a> His manner appears to have been
controversial and full of asperity towards antagonists; but what
is most remarkable is the plain-spoken manner in which he declared
himself against the popular religion, and in which he denounced as
abominable the descriptions of the gods given by Homer and Hesiod.<a
id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a></p>

<p>He is said to have controverted the doctrines both of Thalês and
Pythagoras: this is probable enough; but he seems to have taken his
start from the philosophy of Anaximander,—not, however, to adopt it,
but to reverse it,—and to set forth an opinion which we may call its
contrary. Nature, in the conception of Anaximander, consisted of a
Something having no other attribute except the unlimited power of
generating and cancelling phenomenal changes: in this doctrine, the
something or substratum existed only in and for those changes, and
could not be said to exist at all in any other sense: the permanent
was thus merged and lost in the variable,—the one in the many.
Xenophanês laid down the exact opposite: he conceived Nature as one
unchangeable and indivisible whole, spherical, animated, endued with
reason, and penetrated by or indeed identical with God: he denied
the objective reality of all change, or generation, or destruction,
which he seems to have considered as only changes or modifications in
the percipient, and perhaps different in one percipient and another.
That which exists, he maintained, could not have been generated, nor
could it ever be destroyed: there was neither real generation nor
real destruction of anything; but that which<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_389">[p. 389]</span> men took for such, was the change
in their own feelings and ideas. He thus recognized the permanent
without the variable,<a id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707"
class="fnanchor">[707]</a>—the one without the many. And his
treatment of the received religious creed was in harmony with such
physical or metaphysical hypothesis; for while he held the whole
of Nature to be God, without parts or change, he at the same time
pronounced the popular gods to be entities of subjective fancy,
imagined by men after their own model: if oxen or lions were to
become religious, he added, they would in like manner provide for
themselves gods after their respective shapes and characters.<a
id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a>
This hypothesis, which seemed to set aside altogether the study of
the sensible world as a source of knowledge, was expounded briefly,
and as it should seem, obscurely and rudely, by Xenophanês; at
least we may infer thus much from the slighting epithet applied
to him by Aristotle.<a id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709"
class="fnanchor">[709]</a> But his successors, Parmenidês and Zeno,
in the succeeding century, expanded it considerably, supported it
with extraordinary acuteness of dialectics, and even superadded a
second part, in which the phenomena of sense—though considered only
as appearances, not partaking in the reality of the one Ens—were yet
explained by a new physical hypothesis; so that they will be found
to exercise great influence over the speculations both of Plato and
Aristotle. We discover in Xenophanês, moreover, a vein of skepticism,
and a mournful despair as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">[p.
390]</span> to the attainability of certain knowledge,<a
id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a>
which the nature of his philosophy was well calculated to suggest,
and in which the sillograph Timon of the third century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, who seems to have spoken of Xenophanês better than of
most of the other philosophers, powerfully sympathized.</p>

<p>The cosmogony of Pherekydês of Syrus, contemporary of Anaximander
and among the teachers of Pythagoras, seems, according to the
fragments preserved, a combination of the old legendary fancies
with Orphic mysticism,<a id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711"
class="fnanchor">[711]</a> and probably exercised little influence
over the subsequent course of Grecian philosophy. By what has been
said of Thalês, Anaximander, and Xenophanês, it will be seen that
the sixth century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> witnessed the opening of
several of those roads of intellectual speculation which the later
philosophers pursued farther, or at least from which they branched
off. Before the year 500 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> many interesting
questions were thus brought into discussion, which Solon, who died
about 558 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, had never heard of,—just as he may
probably never have seen the map of Anaximander. But neither of
these two distinguished men—Anaximander or Xenophanês—was anything
more than a speculative inquirer. The third eminent name of this
century, of whom I am now about to speak,—Pythagoras, combined in
his character disparate elements which require rather a longer
development.</p>

<p>Pythagoras was founder of a brotherhood, originally brought
together by a religious influence, and with observances approaching
to monastic peculiarity,—working in a direction at once religious,
political, and scientific, and exercising for some time a real
political ascendency,—but afterwards banished from government and
state affairs into a sectarian privacy with scientific pursuits,
not without, however, still producing some statesmen individually
distinguished. Amidst the multitude of false and apocryphal
statements which circulated in antiquity respecting this celebrated
man, we find a few important facts reasonably attested and
deserving credence. He was a native of Samos,<a id="FNanchor_712"
href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_391">[p. 391]</span> son of an opulent merchant named
Mnêsarchus,—or, according to some of his later and more fervent
admirers, of Apollo; born, as far as we can make out, about the
50th Olympiad, or 580 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> On the many marvels
recounted respecting his youth, it is unnecessary to dwell. Among
them may be numbered his wide-reaching travels, said to have
been prolonged for nearly thirty years, to visit the Arabians,
the Syrians, the Phenicians, the Chaldæans, the Indians, and
the Gallic Druids. But there is reason to believe that he
really visited Egypt<a id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713"
class="fnanchor">[713]</a>—perhaps also Phenicia—and Babylon, then
Chaldæan and independent. At the time when he saw Egypt, between
560-540 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, about one century earlier than
Herodotus, it was under Amasis, the last of its own kings, with
its peculiar native character yet unimpaired by foreign conquest,
and only slightly modified by the admission during the preceding
century of Grecian mercenary troops and traders. The spectacle of
Egyptian habits, the conversation of the priests, and the initiation
into various mysteries or secret rites and stories not accessible
to the general public, may very naturally have impressed the mind
of Pythagoras, and given him that turn for mystic observance,
asceticism, and peculiarity of diet and clothing,—which manifested
itself from the same cause among several of his contemporaries, but
which was not a common phenomenon in the primitive Greek religion.
Besides visiting Egypt, Pythagoras is also said to have profited
by the teaching of Thalês, of Anaximander, and of Pherekydês
of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">[p. 392]</span> Syros.<a
id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a>
Amidst the towns of Ionia, he would, moreover, have an opportunity
of conversing with many Greek navigators who had visited foreign
countries, especially Italy and Sicily. His mind seems to have been
acted upon and impelled by this combined stimulus,—partly towards an
imaginative and religious vein of speculation, with a life of mystic
observance,—partly towards that active exercise, both of mind and
body, which the genius of an Hellenic community so naturally tended
to suggest.</p>

<p>Of the personal doctrines or opinions of Pythagoras, whom we must
distinguish from Philolaus and the subsequent Pythagoreans, we have
little certain knowledge, though doubtless the first germ of their
geometry, arithmetic, astronomy, etc. must have proceeded from him.
But that he believed in the metempsychosis or transmigration of the
souls of deceased men into other men, as well as into animals, we
know, not only by other evidence, but also by the testimony of his
contemporary, the philosopher Xenophanês of Elea. Pythagoras, seeing
a dog beaten, and hearing him howl, desired the striker to desist,
saying: “It is the soul of a friend of mine, whom I recognized by his
voice.” This—together with the general testimony of Hêrakleitus, that
Pythagoras was a man of extensive research and acquired instruction,
but artful for mischief and destitute of sound judgment—is all that
we know about him from contemporaries. Herodotus, two generations
afterwards, while he conceives the Pythagoreans as a peculiar
religious order, intimates that both Orpheus and Pythagoras
had derived the doctrine of the metempsychosis from Egypt, but
had pretended to it as their own without acknowledgment.<a
id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">[p. 393]</span>Pythagoras
combines the character of a sophist (a man of large observation, and
clever, ascendent, inventive mind,—the original sense of the word
Sophist, prior to the polemics of the Platonic school, and the only
sense known to Herodotus<a id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716"
class="fnanchor">[716]</a>) with that of an inspired teacher,
prophet, and worker of miracles,—approaching to and sometimes
even confounded with the gods,—and employing all these gifts to
found a new special order of brethren, bound together by religious
rites and observances peculiar to themselves. In his prominent
vocation, analogous to that of Epimenidês, Orpheus, or Melampus, he
appears as the revealer of a mode of life calculated to raise his
disciples above the level of mankind, and to recommend them to the
favor of the gods; the Pythagorean life, like the Orphic life,<a
id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a>
being intended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">[p. 394]</span>
as the exclusive prerogative of the brotherhood,—approached only
by probation and initiatory ceremonies which were adapted to
select enthusiasts rather than to an indiscriminate crowd,—and
exacting entire mental devotion to the master.<a id="FNanchor_718"
href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> In these lofty
pretensions the Agrigentine Empedoklês seems to have greatly copied
him, though with some varieties, about half a century afterwards.<a
id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a>
While Aristotle tells us that the Krotoniates identified Pythagoras
with the Hyperborean Apollo, the satirical Timon pronounced him to
have been “a juggler of solemn speech, engaged in fishing for men.”<a
id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a>
This is the same character, looked at from the different points of
view of the believer and the unbeliever. There is, however, no reason
for regarding Pythagoras as an impostor, because experience seems to
show, that while in certain ages it is not difficult for a man to
persuade others that he is inspired, it is still less difficult for
him to contract the same belief himself.</p>

<p>Looking at the general type of Pythagoras, as conceived by
witnesses in and nearest to his own age,—Xenophanês, Hêrakleitus,
Herodotus, Plato, Aristotle, Isokratês,<a id="FNanchor_721"
href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a>—we find in
him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">[p. 395]</span> chiefly
the religious missionary and schoolmaster, with little of the
politician. His efficiency in the latter character, originally
subordinate, first becomes prominent in those glowing fancies
which the later Pythagoreans communicated to Aristoxenus and
Dikæarchus. The primitive Pythagoras inspired by the gods to reveal
a new mode of life,<a id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722"
class="fnanchor">[722]</a>—the Pythagorean life,—and to promise
divine favor to a select and docile few, as the recompense of strict
ritual obedience, of austere self-control, and of laborious training,
bodily as well as mental. To speak with confidence of the details
of his training, ethical or scientific, and of the doctrines which
he promulgated, is impossible; for neither he himself nor any of
his disciples anterior to Philolaus—who was separated from him by
about one intervening generation—left any memorials in writing.<a
id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a>
Numbers and lines, studied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">[p.
396]</span> partly in their own mutual relations, partly under
various symbolizing fancies, presented themselves to him as the
primary constituent elements of the universe, and as a sort of
magical key to phenomena, physical as well as moral. And these
mathematical tendencies in his teaching, expanded by Pythagoreans,
his successors, and coinciding partly also, as has been before
stated, with the studies of Anaximander and Thalês, acquired more
and more development, so as to become one of the most glorious and
profitable manifestations of Grecian intellect. Living as Pythagoras
did at a time when the stock of experience was scanty, the license
of hypothesis unbounded, and the process of deduction without rule
or verifying test,—he was thus fortunate enough to strike into
that track of geometry and arithmetic, in which, from data of
experience few, simple, and obvious, an immense field of deductive
and verifiable investigation may be travelled over. We must at the
same time remark, however, that in his mind this track, which now
seems so straightforward and well defined, was clouded by strange
fancies which it is not easy to understand, and from which it was
but partially cleared by his successors. Of his spiritual training
much is said, though not upon very good authority. We hear of his
memorial discipline, his monastic self-scrutiny, his employment
of music to soothe disorderly passions,<a id="FNanchor_724"
href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> his long novitiate of
silence, his knowledge of physiognomy, which enabled him to detect
even without trial unworthy subjects, his peculiar diet, and his
rigid care for sobriety as well as for bodily vigor. He is also said
to have inculcated abstinence from animal food, and this feeling
is so naturally connected with the doctrine of the metempsychosis,
that we may well believe him to have entertained it, as Empedoklês
also did after him.<a id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725"
class="fnanchor">[725]</a> It is certain that there were
peculiar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">[p. 397]</span>
observances, and probably a certain measure of self-denial
embodied in the Pythagorean life; but on the other hand, it seems
equally certain that the members of the order cannot have been all
subjected to the same diet, or training, or studies. For Milo the
Krotoniate was among them,<a id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726"
class="fnanchor">[726]</a> the strongest man and the unparalleled
wrestler of his age,—who cannot possibly have dispensed with
animal food and ample diet (even setting aside the tales about his
voracious appetite), and is not likely to have bent his attention
on speculative study. Probably Pythagoras did not enforce the same
bodily or mental discipline on all, or at least knew when to grant
dispensations. The order, as it first stood under him, consisted of
men different both in temperament and aptitude, but bound together
by common religious observances and hopes, common reverence for
the master, and mutual attachment as well as pride in each other’s
success; and it must thus be distinguished from the Pythagoreans
of the fourth century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, who had no communion
with wrestlers, and comprised only ascetic, studious men, generally
recluse, though in some cases rising to political distinction.</p>

<p>The succession of these Pythagoreans, never very numerous, seems
to have continued until about 300 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, and then
nearly died out; being superseded by other schemes of philosophy more
suited to cultivated Greeks of the age after Sokratês. But during
the time of Cicero, two centuries afterwards, the orientalizing
tendency—then beginning to spread over the Grecian and Roman
world, and becoming gradually stronger and stronger—caused the
Pythagorean philosophy to be again revived. It was revived too,
with little or none of its scientific tendencies, but with more
than its primitive religious and imaginative fanaticism,<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_398">[p. 398]</span>—Apollonius of Tyana
constituting himself a living copy of Pythagoras. And thus, while
the scientific elements developed by the disciples of Pythagoras had
become disjoined from all peculiarity of sect, and passed into the
general studious world,—the original vein of mystic and ascetic fancy
belonging to the master, without any of that practical efficiency of
body and mind which had marked his first followers, was taken up anew
into the pagan world, along with the disfigured doctrines of Plato.
Neo-Pythagorism, passing gradually into Neo-Platonism, outlasted
the other more positive and masculine systems of pagan philosophy,
as the contemporary and rival of Christianity. A large proportion
of the false statements concerning Pythagoras come from these
Neo-Pythagoreans, who were not deterred by the want of memorials from
illustrating, with ample latitude of fancy, the ideal character of
the master.</p>

<p>That an inquisitive man like Pythagoras, at a time when there
were hardly any books to study, would visit foreign countries, and
converse with all the Grecian philosophical inquirers within his
reach, is a matter which we should presume, even if no one attested
it; and our witnesses carry us very little beyond this general
presumption. What doctrines he borrowed, or from whom, we are unable
to discover. But, in fact, his whole life and proceedings bear the
stamp of an original mind, and not of a borrower,—a mind impressed
both with Hellenic and with non-Hellenic habits and religion, yet
capable of combining the two in a manner peculiar to himself; and
above all, endued with those talents for religion and personal
ascendency over others, which told for much more than the intrinsic
merit of his ideas. We are informed that after extensive travels
and inquiries he returned to Samos, at the age of about forty: he
then found his native island under the despotism of Polykratês,
which rendered it an unsuitable place either for free sentiments
or for marked individuals. Unable to attract hearers, or found
any school or brotherhood, in his native island, he determined to
expatriate. And we may presume that at this period (about 535-530
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>) the recent subjugation of Ionia by the Persians
was not without influence on his determination. The trade between
the Asiatic and the Italian Greeks,—and even the intimacy between
Milêtus and Knidus on the one side, and Sybaris and Tarentum<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_399">[p. 399]</span> on the other,—had been
great and of long standing, so that there was more than one motive
to determine him to the coast of Italy; in which direction also
his contemporary Xenophanês, the founder of the Eleatic school of
philosophy, emigrated, seemingly, about the same time,—from Kolophon
to Zanklê, Katana, and Elea.<a id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727"
class="fnanchor">[727]</a></p>

<p>Kroton and Sybaris were at this time in their fullest
prosperity,—among the first and most prosperous cities of the
Hellenic name. To the former of the two Pythagoras directed his
course. A council of one thousand persons, taken from among the
heirs and representatives of the principal proprietors at its first
foundation, was here invested with the supreme authority: in what
manner the executive offices were filled, we have no information.
Besides a great extent of power, and a numerous population, the large
mass of whom had no share in the political franchise, Kroton stood
at this time distinguished for two things,—the general excellence of
the bodily habit of the citizens, attested, in part, by the number
of conquerors furnished to the Olympic games,—and the superiority of
its physicians, or surgeons.<a id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728"
class="fnanchor">[728]</a> These two points were, in fact, greatly
connected with each other. For the therapeutics of the day consisted
not so much of active remedies as of careful diet and regimen;
while the trainer, who dictated the life of an athlete during
his long and fatiguing preparation for an Olympic contest, and
the professional superintendent of the youths who frequented the
public gymnasia, followed out the same general views, and acted
upon the same basis of knowledge, as the physician who prescribed
for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">[p. 400]</span> state
of positive bad health.<a id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729"
class="fnanchor">[729]</a> Of medical education properly so called,
especially of anatomy, there was then little or nothing.<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_401">[p. 401]</span> The physician acquired
his knowledge from observation of men sick as well as healthy, and
from a careful notice of the way in which the human body was acted
upon by surrounding agents and circumstances: and this same knowledge
was not less necessary for the trainer; so that the same place
which contained the best men in the latter class was also likely
to be distinguished in the former. It is not improbable that this
celebrity of Kroton may have been one of the reasons which determined
Pythagoras to go thither; for among the precepts ascribed to him,
precise rules as to diet and bodily regulation occupy a prominent
place. The medical or surgical celebrity of Dêmokêdês (son-in-law of
the Pythagorean Milo), to whom allusion has been made in a former
chapter, is contemporaneous with the presence of Pythagoras at
Kroton; and the medical men of Magna Græcia maintained themselves in
credit, as rivals of the schools of the Asklepiads at Kôs and Knidus,
throughout all the fifth and fourth centuries <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small></p>

<p>The biographers of Pythagoras tell us that his arrival there,
his preaching, and his conduct, produced an effect almost electric
upon the minds of the people, with an extensive reform, public as
well as private. Political discontent was repressed, incontinence
disappeared, luxury became discredited, and the women, hastened to
exchange their golden ornaments for the simplest attire. No less
than two thousand persons were converted at his first preaching;
and so effective were his discourses to the youth, that the
Supreme Council of One Thousand invited him into their assembly,
solicited his advice, and even offered to constitute him their<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_402">[p. 402]</span> prytanis, or president,
while his wife and daughter were placed at the head of the religious
processions of females.<a id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730"
class="fnanchor">[730]</a> Nor was his influence confined to Kroton.
Other towns in Italy and Sicily,—Sybaris, Metapontum, Rhêgium,
Katana, Himera, etc., all felt the benefit of his exhortations, which
extricated some of them even from slavery. Such are the tales of
which the biographers of Pythagoras are full.<a id="FNanchor_731"
href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> And we see that
even the disciples of Aristotle, about the year 300 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,—Aristoxenus, Dikæarchus, Herakleidês of Pontus, etc.,
are hardly less charged with them than the Neo-Pythagoreans of
three or four centuries later: they doubtless heard them from their
contemporary Pythagoreans,<a id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732"
class="fnanchor">[732]</a> the last members of a declining sect,
among whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">[p. 403]</span> the
attributes of the primitive founder passed for godlike, but who had
no memorials, no historical judgment, and no means of forming a
true conception of Kroton as it stood in 530 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small><a
id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a></p>

<p>To trace these tales to a true foundation is impossible: but we
may entertain reasonable belief that the success of Pythagoras,
as a person favored by the gods and patentee of divine secrets,
was very great,—that he procured to himself both the reverence of
the multitude and the peculiar attachment and obedience of many
devoted adherents, chiefly belonging to the wealthy and powerful
classes,—that a select body of these adherents, three hundred in
number, bound themselves by a sort of vow both to Pythagoras and to
each other, and adopted a peculiar diet, ritual, and observances,
as a token of union,—though without anything like community of
property, which some have ascribed to them. Such a band of men,
standing high in the city for wealth and station, and bound together
by this intimate tie, came by almost unconscious tendency to
mingle political ambition with religious and scientific pursuits.
Political clubs with sworn members, under one form or another, were
a constant phenomenon in the Grecian cities,<a id="FNanchor_734"
href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a><span class="pagenum"
id="Page_404">[p. 404]</span> and the Pythagorean order at its first
formation was the most efficient of all clubs; since it presented an
intimacy of attachment among its members, as well as a feeling of
haughty exclusiveness against the public without, such as no other
fraternity could parallel.<a id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735"
class="fnanchor">[735]</a> The devoted attachment of Pythagoreans
towards each other is not less emphatically set forth than their
contempt for every one else. In fact, these two attributes of the
order seem the best ascertained, as well as the most permanent of
all: moreover, we may be sure that the peculiar observances of the
order passed for exemplary virtues in the eyes of its members, and
exalted ambition into a duty, by making them sincerely believe
that they were the only persons fit to govern. It is no matter of
surprise, then, to learn that the Pythagoreans gradually drew to
themselves great ascendency in the government of Kroton. And as
similar clubs, not less influential, were formed at Metapontum and
other places, so the Pythagorean order spread its net and dictated
the course of affairs over a large portion of Magna Græcia. Such
ascendency of the Pythagoreans must have procured for the master
himself some real, and still more supposed, influence over the march
of government at Kroton and elsewhere, of a nature not then possessed
by any of his contemporaries throughout Greece.<a id="FNanchor_736"
href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> But his influence
was probably exercised in the background, through the medium of the
brotherhood who reverenced him: for it is hardly conformable to Greek
manners that a stranger of his character should guide personally and
avowedly the political affairs of any Grecian city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">[p. 405]</span>Nor are we to
believe that Pythagoras came originally to Kroton with the express
design of creating for himself an ascendent political position,—still
less that he came for the purpose of realizing a great preconceived
political idea, and transforming Kroton into a model-city of pure
Dorism, as has been supposed by some eminent modern authors. Such
schemes might indeed be ascribed to him by Pythagoreans of the
Platonic age, when large ideas of political amelioration were
rife in the minds of speculative men,—by men disposed to forego
the authorship of their own opinions, and preferring to accredit
them as traditions handed down from a founder who had left no
memorials; but it requires better evidence than theirs to make
us believe that any real Greek born in 580 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>
actually conceived such plans. We cannot construe the scheme of
Pythagoras as going farther than the formation of a private,
select order of brethren, embracing his religious fancies, ethical
tone, and germs of scientific idea,—and manifesting adhesion by
those observances which Herodotus and Plato call the Pythagorean
orgies and mode of life. And his private order became politically
powerful, because he was skilful or fortunate enough to enlist a
sufficient number of wealthy Krotoniates, possessing individual
influence which they strengthened immensely by thus regimenting
themselves in intimate union. The Pythagorean orgies or religious
ceremonies were not inconsistent with public activity, bodily
as well as mental: probably the rich men of the order may have
been rendered even more active, by being fortified against the
temptations of a life of indulgence. The character of the order
as it first stood, different from that to which it was afterwards
reduced, was indeed religious and exclusive, but also active and
domineering; not despising any of those bodily accomplishments
which increased the efficiency of the Grecian citizen, and which so
particularly harmonized with the preëxisting tendencies of Kroton.<a
id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a>
Niebuhr<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">[p. 406]</span> and O.
Müller have even supposed that the select Three Hundred Pythagoreans
constituted a sort of smaller senate at that<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_407">[p. 407]</span> city,<a id="FNanchor_738"
href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a>—an hypothesis no way
probable; we may rather conceive them as a powerful private club,
exercising ascendency in the interior of the senate, and governing
through the medium of the constituted authorities. Nor can we receive
without great allowance the assertion of Varro,<a id="FNanchor_739"
href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> who, assimilating
Pythagoras to Plato, tells us that he confined his instructions on
matters of government to chosen disciples, who had gone through a
complete training, and had reached the perfection of wisdom and
virtue. It seems more probable that the political Pythagoreans were
those who were most qualified for action, and least for speculation.
And we may reasonably suppose in the general of the order that
skill in turning to account the aptitudes of individuals, which two
centuries ago was so conspicuous in the Jesuits; to whom, in various
ways, the Pythagoreans bear considerable resemblance. All that we can
be said to know about their political principles is, that they were
exclusive and aristocratical, adverse to the control and interference
of the people; a circumstance no way disadvantageous to them, since
they coincided in this respect with the existing government of the
city,—had not their own conduct brought additional odium on the old
aristocracy, and raised up an aggravated democratical opposition,
carried to the most deplorable lengths of violence.</p>

<p>All the information which we possess, apocryphal as it is,
respecting this memorable club, is derived from its warm admirers;
yet even their statements are enough to explain how it came to
provoke deadly and extensive enmity. A stranger coming to teach
new religious dogmas and observances, with a tincture of science
and some new ethical ideas and phrases, though he would obtain
some zealous votaries, would also bring upon himself a certain
measure of antipathy. Extreme strictness of observances, combined
with the art of touching skilfully the springs of religious
terror in others, would indeed do much both to fortify and to
exalt him. But when it was discovered that science, philosophy,
and even the mystic revelations of religion, whatever they were,
remained confined to the private talk and practice of<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_408">[p. 408]</span> the disciples, and
were thus thrown into the background, while all that was seen
and felt without, was the political predominance of an ambitious
fraternity,—we need not wonder that Pythagorism in all its parts
became odious to a large portion of the community. Moreover, we
find the order represented not merely as constituting a devoted and
exclusive political party, but also as manifesting an ostentatious
self-conceit throughout their personal demeanor,<a id="FNanchor_740"
href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a>—refusing the
hand of fellowship to all except the brethren, and disgusting
especially their own familiar friends and kinsmen. So far as
we know Grecian philosophy, this is the only instance in which
it was distinctly abused for political and party objects: the
early days of the Pythagorean order stand distinguished for such
perversion, which, fortunately for the progress of philosophy,
never presented itself afterwards in Greece.<a id="FNanchor_741"
href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> Even at Athens,
however, we shall hereafter see that Sokratês, though standing really
aloof from all party intrigue, incurred much of his unpopularity
from supposed political conjunction with Kritias and Alkibiadês,<a
id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a>
to which, indeed, the orator Æschinês<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_409">[p. 409]</span> distinctly ascribes his condemnation,
speaking about sixty years after the event. Had Sokratês been known
as the founder of a band holding together intimately for ambitious
purposes, the result would have been eminently pernicious to
philosophy, and probably much sooner pernicious to himself.</p>

<p>It was this cause which brought about the complete and violent
destruction of the Pythagorean order. Their ascendency had provoked
such wide-spread discontent, that their enemies became emboldened
to employ extreme force against them. Kylon and Ninon—the former
of whom is said to have sought admittance into the order, but to
have been rejected on account of his bad character—took the lead
in pronounced opposition to the Pythagoreans; and the odium which
the latter had incurred extended itself farther to the Senate of
One Thousand, through the medium of which their ascendency had been
exercised. Propositions were made for rendering the government more
democratical, and for constituting a new senate, taken by lot from
all the people, before which the magistrates should go through
their trial of accountability after office; an opportunity being
chosen in which the Senate of One Thousand had given signal offence
by refusing to divide among the people the recently conquered
territory of Sybaris.<a id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743"
class="fnanchor">[743]</a> In spite of the opposition of the
Pythagoreans, this change of government was carried through. Ninon
and Kylon, their principal enemies, made use of it to exasperate
the people still farther against the order, until they provoked
actual popular violence against it. The Pythagoreans were attacked
when assembled in their meeting-house near the temple of Apollo,
or, as some said, in the house of Milo: the building was set
on fire, and many of the members perished;<a id="FNanchor_744"
href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> none but the
younger and more vigorous escaping. Similar disturbances, and the
like violent suppression of the order, with destruction of several
among the leading citizens, are said to have taken place<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_410">[p. 410]</span> in other cities of
Magna Græcia,—Tarentum, Metapontum, Kaulonia. And we are told that
these cities remained for some time in a state of great disquietude
and commotion from which they were only rescued by the friendly
mediation of the Peloponnesian Achæans, the original founders of
Sybaris and Kroton,—assisted, indeed, by mediators from other parts
of Greece. The cities were at length pacified, and induced to adopt
an amicable congress, with common religious festivals at a temple
founded expressly for the purpose, and dedicated to Zeus Homarius.<a
id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a></p>

<p>Thus perished the original Pythagorean order. Respecting
Pythagoras himself, there were conflicting accounts; some
representing that he was burnt in the temple with his disciples;<a
id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a>
others, that he had died a short time previously; others again
affirmed that he was alive at the time, but absent, and that he
died not long afterwards in exile, after forty days of voluntary
abstinence from food. His tomb was still shown at Metapontum in
the days of Cicero.<a id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747"
class="fnanchor">[747]</a> As an active brotherhood, the
Pythago<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">[p. 411]</span>reans
never revived; but the dispersed members came together as a sect, for
common religious observances and common pursuit of science. They were
readmitted, after some interval, into the cities of Magna Græcia,<a
id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a>
from which they had been originally expelled, but to which the sect
is always considered as particularly belonging,—though individual
members of it are found besides at Thebes and other cities of Greece.
Indeed, some of these later Pythagoreans sometimes even acquired
great political influence, as we see in the case of the Tarentine
Archytas, the contemporary of Plato.</p>

<p>It has already been stated that the period when Pythagoras
arrived at Kroton may be fixed somewhere between <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> 540-530; and his arrival is said to have occurred at a
time of great depression in the minds of the Krotoniates. They had
recently been defeated by the united Lokrians and Rhegians, vastly
inferior to themselves in number, at the river Sagra; and the
humiliation thus brought upon them is said to have rendered them
docile to the training of the Samian missionary.<a id="FNanchor_749"
href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> As the birth of
the Pythagorean order is thus connected with the defeat of the
Krotoniates at the Sagra, so its extinction is also connected with
their victory over the Sybarites at the river Traeis, or Trionto,
about twenty years afterwards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">[p. 412]</span>Of the history
of these two great Achæan cities we unfortunately know very little.
Though both were powerful, yet down to the period of 510 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, Sybaris seems to have been decidedly the greatest: of
its dominion as well as of its much-denounced luxury I have spoken
in a former chapter.<a id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750"
class="fnanchor">[750]</a> It was at that time that the war broke
out between them which ended in the destruction of Sybaris. It
is certain that the Sybaritans were aggressors in the war; but
by what causes it had been preceded in their own town, or what
provocation they had received, we make out very indistinctly.
There had been a political revolution at Sybaris, we are told, not
long before, in which a popular leader named Têlys had headed a
rising against the oligarchical government, and induced the people
to banish five hundred of the leading rich men, as well as to
confiscate their properties. He had acquired the sovereignty and
become despot of Sybaris;<a id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751"
class="fnanchor">[751]</a> and it appears that he, or his rule at
Sybaris, was much abhorred at Kroton,—since the Krotoniate Philippus,
a man of splendid muscular form and an Olympic victor, was exiled
for having engaged himself to marry the daughter of Têlys.<a
id="FNanchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a>
According to the narrative given by the later Pythagoreans, those
exiles, whom Têlys had driven from Sybaris, took refuge at Kroton,
and cast themselves as suppliants on the altars for protection. It
may well be, indeed, that they were in part Pythagoreans of Sybaris.
A body of powerful exiles, harbored in a town so close at hand,
naturally inspired alarm, and Têlys demanded that they should be
delivered up, threatening war in case of refusal. This demand excited
consternation at Kroton, since the military strength of Sybaris was
decidedly superior. The surrender of the exiles was much debated,
and almost decreed, by the Krotoniates, until<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_413">[p. 413]</span> at length the persuasion of Pythagoras
himself is said to have determined them to risk any hazard sooner
than incur the dishonor of betraying suppliants.</p>

<p>On the demand of the Sybarites being refused, Têlys marched
against Kroton, at the head of a force which is reckoned at three
hundred thousand men.<a id="FNanchor_753" href="#Footnote_753"
class="fnanchor">[753]</a> He marched, too, in defiance of the
strongest religious warnings against the enterprise,—for the
sacrifices, offered on his behalf by the Iamid prophet Kallias of
Elis, were decisively unfavorable, and the prophet himself fled
in terror to Kroton.<a id="FNanchor_754" href="#Footnote_754"
class="fnanchor">[754]</a> Near the river Traeis, or Trionto, he
was met by the forces of Kroton, consisting, we are informed, of
one hundred thousand men, and commanded by the great athlete and
Pythagorean Milo; who was clothed, we are told, in the costume and
armed with the club of Hêraklês. They were farther reinforced,
however, by a valuable ally, the Spartan Dorieus, younger brother of
king Kleomenês, then coasting along the gulf of Tarentum with a body
of colonists, intending to found a settlement in Sicily. A bloody
battle was fought, in which the Sybarites were totally worsted,
with prodigious slaughter; while the victors, fiercely provoked and
giving no quarter, followed up the pursuit so warmly that they took
the city, dispersed its inhabitants, and crushed its whole power<a
id="FNanchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a>
in the short space of seventy days. The Sybarites fled in great
part to Laos and Skidros,<a id="FNanchor_756" href="#Footnote_756"
class="fnanchor">[756]</a> their settlements planted on the
Mediterranean coast, across the Calabrian peninsula. And so eager
were the Krotoniates to render the site of Sybaris untenable, that
they turned the course of the river Krathis so as to overwhelm and
destroy it: the dry bed in which the river had originally flowed
was still visible in the time of Herodotus,<a id="FNanchor_757"
href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> who was among
the settlers in the town of Thurii, afterwards founded, nearly
adjoining.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">[p. 414]</span>It appears,
however, that the Krotoniates for a long time kept the site of
Sybaris deserted, refusing even to allot the territory among the
body of their own citizens: from which circumstances, as has been
before noticed, the commotion against the Pythagorean order is
said to have arisen. They may perhaps have been afraid of the
name and recollections of the city; wherein no large or permanent
establishment was ever formed, until Thurii was established by
Athens about sixty-five years afterwards. Nevertheless, the name
of the Sybarites did not perish. Having maintained themselves at
Laos, Skidros, and elsewhere, they afterwards formed the privileged
Old-citizens among the colonists of Thurii; but misbehaved themselves
in that capacity, and were mostly either slain or expelled. Even
after that, however, the name of Sybaris still remained on a reduced
scale in some portion of the territory. Herodotus recounts what he
was told by the Sybarites, and we find subsequent indications of them
even as late as Theokritus.</p>

<p>The conquest and destruction of the original Sybaris—perhaps in
510 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> the greatest of all Grecian cities—appears
to have excited a strong sympathy in the Hellenic world. In Milêtus,
especially, with which it had maintained intimate union, the
grief was so vehement, that all the Milesians shaved their heads
in token of mourning.<a id="FNanchor_758" href="#Footnote_758"
class="fnanchor">[758]</a> The event happened just at the time
of the expulsion of Hippias from Athens, and must have made a
sensible revolution in the relations of the Greek cities on<span
class="pagenum" id="Page_415">[p. 415]</span> the Italian coast with
the rustic population of the interior. The Krotoniates might destroy
Sybaris, and disperse its inhabitants, but they could not succeed to
its wide dominion over dependent territory; and the extinction of
this great aggregate power, stretching across the peninsula from sea
to sea, lessened the means of resistance against the Oscan movements
from the inland. From this time forward, the cities of Magna Græcia,
as well as those of Ionia, tend to decline in consequence, while
Athens, on the other hand, becomes both more conspicuous and more
powerful. At the invasion of Greece by Xerxês, thirty years after
this conquest of Sybaris, Sparta and Athens send to ask for aid both
from Sicily and Korkyra,—but not from Magna Græcia.</p>

<p>It is much to be regretted that we do not possess fuller
information respecting these important changes among the
Greco-Italian cities, but we may remark that even Herodotus,—himself
a citizen of Thurii, and dwelling on the spot not more than eighty
years after the capture of Sybaris,—evidently found no written
memorials to consult; and could obtain from verbal conversation
nothing better than statements both meagre and contradictory. The
material circumstance, for example, of the aid rendered by the
Spartan Dorieus and his colonists, though positively asserted by the
Sybarites, was as positively denied by the Krotoniates, who alleged
that they had accomplished the conquest by themselves, and with their
own unaided forces. There can be little hesitation in crediting the
affirmative assertion of the Sybarites, who showed to Herodotus
a temple and precinct erected by the Spartan prince in testimony
of his share in the victory, on the banks of the dry, deserted
channel, out of which the Krathis had been turned, and in honor
of the Krathian Athênê.<a id="FNanchor_759" href="#Footnote_759"
class="fnanchor">[759]</a> This of itself forms a proof, coupled
with the positive assertion of the Sybarites, sufficient for the
case. But they produced another indirect argument to confirm it,
which deserves notice. Dorieus had attacked Sybaris while he was
passing along the coast of Italy to go and found a colony in Sicily,
under the express mandate and encouragement of the oracle; and
after tarrying awhile at Sybaris, he pursued his journey to the
south<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">[p. 416]</span>-western
portion of Sicily, where he and nearly all his companions perished
in a battle with the Carthaginians and Egestæans,—though the oracle
had promised him that he should acquire and occupy permanently the
neighboring territory near Mount Eryx. Now the Sybarites deduced from
this fatal disaster of Dorieus and his expedition, combined with the
favorable promise of the oracle beforehand, a confident proof of the
correctness of their own statement that he had fought at Sybaris. For
if he had gone straight to the territory marked out by the oracle,
they argued, without turning aside for any other object, the prophecy
on which his hopes were founded would have been unquestionably
realized, and he would have succeeded; but the ruinous disappointment
which actually overtook him was at once explained, and the truth of
prophecy vindicated, when it was recollected that he had turned aside
to help the Krotoniates against Sybaris, and thus set at nought the
conditions prescribed to him. Upon this argument, Herodotus tells us,
the Sybarites of his day especially insisted.<a id="FNanchor_760"
href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> And while we note
their pious and literal faith in the communications of an inspired
prophet, we must at the same time observe how perfectly that faith
supplied the place of historical premises,—how scanty their stock was
of such legitimate evidence,—and how little they had yet learned to
appreciate its value.</p>

<p>It is to be remarked, that Herodotus, in his brief mention of
the fatal war between Sybaris and Kroton, does not make the least
allusion to Pythagoras or his brotherhood. The least which we can
infer from such silence is, that the part which they played in
reference to the war, and their general ascendency in Magna Græcia,
was in reality less conspicuous and overruling than the Pythagorean
historians set forth. Even making such allowance, however, the
absence of all allusion in Herodotus, to the commotions which
accompanied the subversion of the Pythagoreans, is a surprising
circumstance. Nor can I pass over a perplexing statement in Polybius,
which seems to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">[p. 417]</span>
show that he too must have conceived the history of Sybaris in a way
different from that in which it is commonly represented. He tells
us that after much suffering in Magna Græcia, from the troubles
which followed the expulsion of the Pythagoreans, the cities were
induced by Achæan mediation to come to an accommodation, and even to
establish something like a permanent league, with a common temple
and sacrifices. Now the three cities which he specifies as having
been the first to do this, are Kroton, Sybaris, and Kaulonia.<a
id="FNanchor_761" href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a>
But according to the sequence of events and the fatal war, just
described, between Kroton and Sybaris, the latter city must have been
at that time in ruins; little, if at all, inhabited. I cannot but
infer from this statement of Polybius, that he followed different
authorities respecting the early history of Magna Græcia in the
beginning of the fifth century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small></p>

<p>Indeed, the early history of these cities gives us little
more than a few isolated facts and names. With regard to their
legislators, Zaleukus and Charondas, nothing is made out except
their existence,—and even that fact some ancient critics contested.
Of Zaleukus, whom chronologists place in 664 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,
I have already spoken; the date of Charondas cannot be assigned,
but we may perhaps presume that it was at some time between 600-500
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> He was a citizen of middling station, born
in the Chalkidic colony of Katana in Sicily,<a id="FNanchor_762"
href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> and he framed laws
not only for his own city, but for the other Chalkidic cities
in Sicily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">[p. 418]</span>
and Italy,—Leontini, Naxos, Zanklê, and Rhêgium. The laws and
the solemn preamble ascribed to him by Diodorus and Stobæus,
belong to a later day,<a id="FNanchor_763" href="#Footnote_763"
class="fnanchor">[763]</a> and we are obliged to content ourselves
with collecting the brief hints of Aristotle, who tells us that
the laws of Charondas descended to great minuteness of distinction
and specification, especially in graduating the fine for
offences according to the property of the guilty person fined,<a
id="FNanchor_764" href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a>—but
that there was nothing in his laws strictly original and peculiar,
except that he was the first to introduce the solemn indictment
against perjured witnesses before justice. The perjured witness,
in Grecian ideas, was looked upon as having committed a crime half
religious, half civil; and the indictment raised against him, known
by a peculiar name, partook of both characters, approaching in some
respects to the procedure against a murderer. Such distinct form of
indictment against perjured testimony—with its appropriate name,<a
id="FNanchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a>
which we shall find maintained at Athens<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_419">[p. 419]</span> throughout the best-known days of Attic
law—was first enacted by Charondas.</p>

<p>The geography of the countries occupied in ancient times by the
Illyrians, Macedonians, Pæonians, Thracians, etc., and now possessed
by a great diversity of races, among whom the Turks and Albanians
retain the primitive barbarism without mitigation, is still very
imperfectly understood; though the researches of Colonel Leake, of
Boué, of Grisebach, and others (especially the valuable travels of
the latter), have of late thrown much light upon it. How much our
knowledge is extended in this direction, may be seen by comparing the
map prefixed to Mannert’s Geographie, or to O. Müller’s Dissertation
on the Macedonians, with that in Boué’s Travels, but the extreme
deficiency of the maps, even as they now stand, is emphatically
noticed by Boué himself (see his Critique des Cartes de la Turquie
in the fourth volume of his Voyage),—by Paul Joseph Schaffarik, the
learned historian of the Sclavonic race, in the preface attached by
him to Dr. Joseph Müller’s Topographical Account of Albania,—and
by Grisebach, who in his surveys, taken from the summits of the
mountains Peristeri and Ljubatrin, found the map differing at every
step from the bearings which presented themselves to his eye. It
is only since Boué and Grisebach that the idea has been completely
dismissed, derived originally from Strabo, of a straight line of
mountains (εὐθεῖα γραμμὴ, Strabo, lib. vii, Fragm. 3) running across
from the Adriatic to the Euxine, and sending forth other lateral
chains in a direction nearly southerly. The mountains of Turkey in
Europe, when examined with the stock of geological science which M.
Viquesnel (the companion of Boué) and Dr. Grisebach bring to the
task, are found to belong to systems very different, and to present
evidences of conditions of formation often quite independent of each
other.</p>

<p>The thirteenth chapter of Grisebach’s Travels presents the
best account which has yet been given of the chain of Skardus and
Pindus: he has been the first to prove clearly, that the Ljubatrin,
which immediately overhangs the plain of Kossovo at the southern
border of Servia and Bosnia, is the north-eastern extremity of a
chain of mountains reaching southward to the frontiers of Ætolia,
in a direction not very wide of N-S.,—with the single interruption
(first brought to view by Colonel Leake) of the Klissoura of
Devol,—a complete gap, where the river Devol, rising on the eastern
side, crosses the chain and joins the Apsus, or Beratino, on the
western,—(it is remarkable that both in the map of Boué and in that
annexed to Dr. Joseph Müller’s Topographical Description of Albania,
the river Devol is made to join the Genussus, or Skoumi, considerably
north of the Apsus, though Colonel Leake’s map gives the correct
course.) In Grisebach’s nomenclature Skardus is made to reach from
the Ljubatrin as its north-eastern extremity, south-westward and
southward as far as the Klissoura of Devol: south of that point
Pindus commences, in a continuation, however, of the same axis.</p>

<p>In reference to the seats of the ancient Illyrians and
Macedonians Grisebach has made another observation of great
importance (vol. ii, p. 121). Between the north-eastern extremity,
Mount Ljubatrin, and the Klissoura of Devol, there are in the mighty
and continuous chain of Skardus (above seven thousand feet high)
only two passes fit for an army to cross: one near the northern
extremity of the chain, over which Grisebach himself crossed, from
Kalkandele to Prisdren, a very high <i>col</i>, not less than five
thousand feet above the level of the sea; the other, considerably to
the southward, and lower as well as easier, nearly in the latitude of
Lychnidus, or Ochrida. It was over this last pass that the Roman Via
Egnatia travelled, and that the modern road from Scutari and Durazzo
to Bitolia now travels. With the exception of these two partial
depressions, the long mountain-ridge maintains itself undiminished in
height, admitting, indeed, paths by which a small company either of
travellers or of Albanian robbers from the Dibren, may cross (there
is a path of this kind which connects Struga with Ueskioub, mentioned
by Dr. Joseph Müller, p. 70, and some others by Boué, vol. iv, p.
546), but nowhere admitting the passage of an army.</p>

<p>To attack the Macedonians, therefore, an Illyrian army would have
to go through one or other of these passes, or else to go round the
north-eastern pass of Katschanik, beyond the extremity of Ljubatrin.
And we shall find that, in point of fact, the military operations
recorded between the two nations carry us usually in one or other
of these directions. The military proceedings of Brasidas (Thucyd.
iv, 124),—of Philip the son of Amyntas king of Macedon (Diodor. xvi,
8),—of Alexander the Great in the first year of his reign (Arrian, i,
5), all bring us to the pass near Lychnidus (compare Livy, xxxii, 9;
Plutarch, Flaminin. c. 4); while the Illyrian Dardani and Autariatæ
border upon Pæonia, to the north of Pelagonia, and threaten Macedonia
from the north-east of the mountain-chain of Skardus. The Autariatæ
are not far removed from the Pæonian Agrianes, who dwelt near the
sources of the Strymon, and both Autariatæ and Dardani threatened
the return march of Alexander from the Danube into Macedonia, after
his successful campaign against the Getæ, low down in the course of
that great river (Arrian, i, 5). Without being able to determine the
precise line of Alexander’s march on this occasion, we may see that
these two Illyrian tribes must have come down to attack him from
Upper Mœsia, and on the eastern side of the Axius. This, and the fact
that the Dardani were the immediate neighbors of the Pæonians, shows
us that their seats could not have been far removed from Upper Mœsia
(Livy, xlv, 29): the fauces Pelagoniæ (Livy, xxxi, 34) are the pass
by which they entered Macedonia from the north. Ptolemy even places
the Dardani at Skopiæ (Ueskioub) (iii, 9); his information about
these countries seems better than that of Strabo.</p>

to the Turkish government: the Pachas cannot extort it without
greater expense and difficulty than the sum gained would repay. The

of the trade in salt, as a bond of connection, see the regulations
of the Romans when they divided Macedonia into four provinces, with
the distinct view of cutting off all connection between one and the
other. All <i>commercium</i> and <i>connubium</i> were forbidden between them:
the fourth region, whose capital was Pelagonia (and which included
all the primitive or Upper Macedonia, east of the range of Pindus
and Skardus), was altogether inland, and it was expressly forbidden
to draw its salt from the third region, or the country between the
Axius and the Peneius; while on the other hand the Illyrian Dardani,
situated northward of Upper Macedonia, received express permission to
draw <i>their</i> salt from this third or maritime region of Macedonia:
the salt was to be conveyed from the Thermaic gulf along the road of
the Axius to Stobi in Pæonia, and was there to be sold at a fixed
price.</p>

<p>The inner or fourth region of Macedonia, which included the
modern Bitoglia and Lake Castoria, could easily obtain its salt from
the Adriatic, by the communication afterwards so well known as the
Roman Egnatian way; but the communication of the Dardani with the
Adriatic led through a country of the greatest possible difficulty,
and it was probably a great convenience to them to receive their
supply from the gulf of Therma by the road along the Vardar (Axius)
(Livy, xlv, 29). Compare the route of Grisebach from Salonichi to
Scutari, in his Reise durch Rumelien, vol. ii.</p>

<p id="Footnote_12"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_12">[12]</a></span> About the cattle in Illyria,
Aristotle, De Mirab. Ausc. c. 128. There is a remarkable passage in
Polybius, wherein he treats the importation of slaves as a matter of
necessity to Greece (iv, 37). The purchasing of the Thracian slaves
in exchange for salt is noticed by Menander.—Θρᾶξ εὐγενὴς εῖ, πρὸς
ἄλας ἠγορασμένος: see Proverb. Zenob. ii, 12, and Diogenian, i, 100.
</p>

<p>The same trade was carried on in antiquity with the nations on
and near Caucasus, from the seaport of Dioskurias at the eastern
extremity of the Euxine (Strabo, xi, p. 506). So little have those
tribes changed, that the Circassians now carry on much the same
trade. Dr. Clarke’s statement carries us back to the ancient world:
“The Circassians frequently sell their children to strangers,
particularly to the Persians and Turks, and their princes supply
the Turkish seraglios with the most beautiful of the prisoners
of both sexes whom they take in war. In their commerce with the
Tchernomorski Cossacks (north of the river Kuban), the Circassians
bring considerable quantities of wood, and the delicious honey of the
mountains, sewed up in goats’ hides, with the hair on the outside.
These articles they exchange for salt, a commodity found in the
neighboring lakes, of a very excellent quality. Salt is more precious
than any other kind of wealth to the Circassians, and it constitutes
the most acceptable present which can be offered to them. They weave
mats of very great beauty, which find a ready market both in Turkey
and Russia. They are also ingenious in the art of working silver and
other metals, and in the fabrication of guns, pistols, and sabres.
Some, which they offered us for sale, we suspected had been procured
in Turkey in exchange for slaves. Their bows and arrows are made
with inimitable skill, and the arrows being tipped with iron, and
otherwise exquisitely wrought, are considered by the Cossacks and
Russians as inflicting incurable wounds.” (Clarke’s Travels, vol. i,
ch. xvi, p. 378.)</p>

c. xvi, pp. 214-216; c. xvii, pp. 244-245).</p>

<p>Respecting the plains comprised in the ancient Pelagonia, see
also the Journal of the younger Pouqueville, in his progress from
Travnik in Bosnia to Janina. He remarks, in the two days’ march from
Prelepe (Prilip) through Bitolia to Florina, “Dans cette route on
parcourt des plaines luxuriantes couvertes de moissons, de vastes
prairies remplies de trèfle, des plateaux abondans en pâturages
inépuisables, où paissent d’innombrables troupeaux de bœufs, de
chèvres, et de menu bétail.... Le blé, le maïs, et les autres
grains sont toujours à très bas prix, à cause de la difficulté des
débouchés, d’où l’on exporte une grande quantité de laines, de
cotons, de peaux d’agneaux, de buffles, et de chevaux, qui passent
par le moyen des caravanes en Hongrie.” (Pouqueville, Voyage dans la
Grèce, tom. ii, ch. 62, p. 495.)</p>

<p>Again, M. Boué remarks upon this same plain, in his Critique des
Cartes de la Turquie, Voyage, vol. iv, p. 483, “La plaine immense de
Prilip, de Bitolia, et de Florina, n’est pas représentée (sur les
cartes) de manière à ce qu’on ait une idée de son étendue, et surtout
de sa largeur.... La plaine de Sarigoul est changée en vallée,” etc.
The basin of the Haliakmôn he remarks to be represented equally
imperfectly on the maps: compare also his Voyage, i, pp. 211, 299,
300.</p>

<p>I notice the more particularly the large proportion of fertile
plain and valley in the ancient Macedonia, because it is often
represented (and even by O. Müller, in his Dissertation on the
ancient Macedonians, attached to his History of the Dorians) as a
cold and rugged land, pursuant to the statement of Livy (xlv, 29),
who says, respecting the fourth region of Macedonia as distributed by
the Romans, “Frigida hæc omnis, duraque cultu, et aspera plaga est:
cultorum quoque ingenia terræ similia habet: ferociores eos et accolæ
barbari faciunt, nunc bello exercentes, nunc in pace miscentes ritus
suos.”</p>

<p>This is probably true of the mountaineers included in the region,
but it is too much generalized.</p>

contradict the opinion both of Mannert (Geogr. der Gr. und Röm. vol.

that the native Macedonians were of Illyrian descent.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_20"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_20">[20]</a></span> The Macedonian military array
seems to have been very like that of the Thessalians,—horsemen
well-mounted and armed, and maintaining good order (Thucyd. ii, 101):
of their infantry, before the time of Philip son of Amyntas, we do
not hear much.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_22"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_22">[22]</a></span> I have followed Herodotus in
stating the original series of occupants on the Thermaic gulf,
anterior to the Macedonian conquests. Thucydidês introduces the
Pæonians between Bottiæans and Mygdonians: he says that the Pæonians
possessed “a narrow strip of land on the side of the Axius, down
to Pella and the sea,” (ii, 96.) If this were true, it would leave
hardly any room for the Bottiæans, whom, nevertheless, Thucydidês
recognizes on the coast; for the whole space between the mouths of
the two rivers, Axius and Haliakmôn, is inconsiderable; moreover,
I cannot but suspect that Thucydidês has been led to believe, by
finding in the Iliad that the Pæonian allies of Troy came from the
Axius, that there <i>must have been</i> old Pæonian settlements at the
mouth of that river, and that he has advanced the inference as if
it were a certified fact. The case is analogous to what he says
about the Bœotians in his preface (upon which O. Müller has already
commented); he stated the emigration of the Bœotians into Bœotia as
having taken place after the Trojan war, but saves the historical
credit of the Homeric catalogue by adding that there had been a
<i>fraction</i> of them in Bœotia <i>before</i>, from whom the contingent which
went to Troy was furnished (ἀποδασμός, Thucyd. i, 12).</p>

<p>On this occasion, therefore, having to choose between Herodotus
and Thucydidês, I prefer the former. O. Müller (On the Macedonians,
sect. 11) would strike out just so much of the assertion of
Thucydidês as positively contradicts Herodotus, and retain the rest;
he thinks that the Pæonians came down <i>very near</i> to the mouth of
the river, but <i>not quite</i>. I confess that this does not satisfy me;
the more so as the passage from Livy by which he would support his
view will appear, on examination, to refer to Pæonia high up the
Axius,—not to a supposed portion of Pæonia near the mouth (Livy, xlv,
29).</p>

<p>Again, I would remark that the original residence of the Pierians
between the Peneius and the Haliakmôn rests chiefly upon the
authority of Thucydidês: Herodotus knows the Pierians in their seats
between Mount Pangæus and the sea, but he gives no intimation that
they had before dwelt south of the Haliakmôn; the tract between the
Haliakmôn and the Peneius is by him conceived as Lower Macedonia, or
Macedonis, reaching to the borders of Thessaly (vii, 127-173). I make
this remark in reference to sects. 7-17 of O. Müller’s Dissertation,
wherein the conception of Herodotus appears incorrectly apprehended,
and some erroneous inferences founded upon it. That this tract
was the original Pieria, there is sufficient reason for believing
(compare Strabo, vii, Frag. 22, with Tafel’s note, and ix, p. 410;
Livy, xliv, 9); but Herodotus notices it only as Macedonia.</p>

<p>Thasus (now Tasso) contains at present a population of about six
thousand Greeks, dispersed in twelve small villages; it exports some
good ship-timber, principally fir, of which there is abundance on the
island, together with some olive oil and wax; but it cannot grow corn
enough even for this small population. No mines either are now, or
have been for a long time, in work.</p>

landed.</p>

<p>The results of modern observation in that country are given
in the Viaggio of Della Cella and in the exploring expedition of
Captain Beechey; see an interesting summary in the History of the
Barbary States, by Dr. Russell (Edinburgh, 1835), ch. v, pp. 160-171.
The chapter on this subject (c. 6) in Thrige’s Historia Cyrênês is
defective, as the author seems never to have seen the careful and
valuable observations of Captain Beechey, and proceeds chiefly on the
statements of Della Cella.</p>

<p>I refer briefly to a few among the many interesting notices of
Captain Beechey. For the site of the ancient Hesperides (Bengazi),
and the “beautiful fertile plain near it, extending to the foot
of a long chain of mountains about fourteen miles distant to the
south-eastward,”—see Beechey, Expedition, ch. xi, pp. 287-315;
“a great many datepalm-trees in the neighborhood,” (ch. xii, pp.
340-345.)</p>

<p>The distance between Bengazi (Hesperides) and Ptolemeta
(Ptolemais, the port of Barka) is fifty-seven geographical miles,
along a fertile and beautiful plain, stretching from the mountains
to the sea. Between these two was situated the ancient Teucheira
(<i>ib.</i> ch. xii, p. 347), about thirty-eight miles from Hesperides (p.
349), in a country highly productive wherever it is cultivated (pp.
350-355). Exuberant vegetation exists near the deserted Ptolemeta, or
Ptolemais, after the winter rains (p. 364). The circuit of Ptolemais,
as measured by the ruins of its walls, was about three and a half
English miles (p. 380).</p>

<p>The road from Barka to Kyrênê presents continued marks of ancient
chariot-wheels (ch. xiv, p. 406); after passing the plain of Mergê,
it becomes hilly and woody, “but on approaching Grenna (Kyrênê) it
becomes more clear of wood; the valleys produce fine crops of barley,
and the hills excellent pasturage for cattle,” (p. 409.) Luxuriant
vegetation after the winter rains in the vicinity of Kyrênê (ch. xv,
p. 465).</p>

<p>Captain Beechey points out the mistaken conceptions which have
been entertained of this region:—</p>

<p>“It is not only in the works of early writers that we find the
nature of the Syrtis misunderstood; for the whole of the space
between Mesurata (<i>i. e.</i> the cape which forms the western extremity
of the Great Syrtis) and Alexandria is described by Leo Africanus,
under the title of Barka, as a wild and desert country, where there
is neither water nor land capable of cultivation. He tells us that
the most powerful among the Mohammedan invaders possessed themselves
of the fertile parts of the coast, leaving the others only the desert
for their abode, exposed to all the miseries and privations attendant
upon it; for this desert (he continues) is far removed from any
habitations, and nothing is produced there whatever. So that if these
poor people would have a supply of grain, or of any other articles
necessary to their existence, they are obliged to pledge their
children to the Sicilians who visit the coast; who, on providing them
with these things, carry off the children they have received....</p>

<p>“It appears to be chiefly from Leo Africanus that modern
historians have derived their idea of what they term the district
and desert of Barka. Yet the whole of the Cyrenaica is comprehended
within the limits which they assign to it; and the authority of
Herodotus, without citing any other, would be amply sufficient to
prove that this tract of country not only was no desert, but was at
all times remarkable for its fertility.... The impression left upon
our minds, after reading the account of Herodotus, would be much more
consistent with the appearance and peculiarities of both, in their
actual state, than that which would result from the description of
any succeeding writer.... The district of Barka, including all the
country between Mesurata and Alexandria, neither is, nor ever was,
so destitute and barren as has been represented: the part of it
which constitutes the Cyrenaica is capable of the highest degree of
cultivation, and many parts of the Syrtis afford excellent pasturage,
while some of it is not only adapted to cultivation, but does
actually produce good crops of barley and dhurra.” (Captain Beechey,
Expedition to Northern Coast of Africa, ch. x, pp. 263, 265, 267,
269: comp. ch. xi, p. 321.)</p>

et fontium ubertatem.” Captain Beechey notices this annual migration
of the Bedouin Arabs:—</p>

<p>“Teucheira (on the coast between Hesperides and Barka) abounds
in wells of excellent water, which are reserved by the Arabs for
their summer consumption, and only resorted to when the more inland
supplies are exhausted: at other times it is uninhabited. Many of the
excavated tombs are occupied as dwelling-houses by the Arabs during
their summer visits to that part of the coast.” (Beechey, Exp. to
North. Afric. ch. xii, p. 354.)</p>

<p>And about the wide mountain plain, or table-land of Mergê, the
site of the ancient Barka, “The water from the mountains inclosing
the plain settles in pools and lakes in different parts of this
spacious valley; and affords a constant supply during the summer
months, to the Arabs who frequent it.” (ch. xiii, p. 390.) The red
earth which Captain Beechey observed in this plain is noticed by
Herodotus in regard to Libya (ii, 12). Stephan. Byz. notices also the
bricks used in building (v. Βάρκη). Derna, too, to the eastward of
Cyrene on the sea-coast, is amply provided with water (ch. xvi, p.
471).</p>

<p>About Kyrênê itself, Captain Beechey states: “During the time,
about a fortnight, of our absence from Kyrene, the changes which
had taken place in the appearance of the country about it were
remarkable. We found the hills on our return covered with Arabs,
their camels, flocks, and herds; the scarcity of water in the
interior at this time having driven the Bedouins to the mountains,
and particularly to Kyrene, where the springs afford at all times
an abundant supply. The corn was all cut, and the high grass and
luxuriant vegetation, which we had found it so difficult to wade
through on former occasions, had been eaten down to the roots by the
cattle.” (ch. xviii, pp. 517-520.)</p>

<p>The winter rains are also abundant, between January and March,
at Bengazi (the ancient Hesperides): sweet springs of water near the
town (ch. xi, pp. 282, 315, 327). About Ptolemeta, or Ptolemais, the
port of the ancient Barka, <i>ib.</i> ch. xii, p. 363.</p>

<p>I construe the word τεμένεα as meaning all the domains, doubtless
large, which had belonged to the Battiad princes; contrary to Thrige
(Historia Cyrênês, ch. 38, p. 150), who restricts the expression to
revenues derived from sacred property. The reference of Wesseling to
Hesych.—Βάττου σίλφιον—is of no avail for illustrating this passage.
</p>

<p>The supposition of O. Müller, that the preceding king had made
himself despotic by means of Egyptian soldiers, appears to me
neither probable in itself, nor admissible upon the simple authority
of Plutarch’s romantic story, when we take into consideration the
silence of Herodotus. Nor is Müller correct in affirming that Demônax
“restored the supremacy of the community:” that legislator superseded
the old kingly political privileges, and framed a new constitution
(see O. Müller, History of Dorians, b. iii, ch. 9. s. 13.)</p>

as having abolished the old tribes and created new ones. I do not
conceive the change in this manner. Demônax did not <i>abolish</i> any
tribes, but distributed for the first time the inhabitants into
tribes. It is possible indeed that, before his time, the Theræans
of Kyrênê may have been divided among themselves into distinct
tribes; but the other inhabitants, having emigrated from a great
number of different places, had never before been thrown into tribes
at all. Some formal enactment or regulation was necessary for this
purpose, to define and sanction that religious, social, and political
communion, which went to make up the idea of the Tribe. It is not to
be assumed, as a matter of course, that there must necessarily have
been tribes anterior to Demônax, among a population so miscellaneous
in its origin.</p>

off with his bow and arrows the obtrusive birds (Ion, 105, 143,

birds—eagles, vultures, and crows—are quite numerous enough to have
been exceedingly troublesome. The whole play of Ion conveys a lively
idea of the Delphian temple and its scenery, with which Euripidês was

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_115"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_115">[115]</a></span> There is considerable
perplexity respecting Krissa and Kirrha, and it still remains a
question among scholars whether the two names denote the same
place or different places; the former is the opinion of O. Müller
(Orchomenos, p. 495). Strabo distinguishes the two. Pausanias
identifies them, conceiving no other town to have ever existed except
the seaport (x, 37, 4). Mannert (Geogr. Gr. Röm. viii, p. 148)
follows Strabo, and represents them as different.</p>

<p>I consider the latter to be the correct opinion, upon the
grounds, and partly, also, on the careful topographical examination
of Professor Ulrichs, which affords an excellent account of the whole
scenery of Delphi (Reisen und Forschungen in Griechenland, Bremen,
1840, chapters 1, 2, 3). The ruins described by him on the high
ground near Kastri, called the Forty Saints, may fairly be considered
as the ruins of Krissa; the ruins of Kirrha are on the sea-shore
near the mouth of the Pleistus. The plain beneath might without
impropriety be called either the Krissæan or the Kirrhæan plain
(Herodot. viii, 32; Strabo, ix, p. 419). Though Strabo was right in
distinguishing Krissa from Kirrha, and right also in the position of
the latter under Kirphis, he conceived incorrectly the situation of
Krissa; and his representation that there were two wars,—in the first
of which, Kirrha was destroyed by the Krissæans, while in the second,
Krissa itself was conquered by the Amphiktyons,—is not confirmed by
any other authority.</p>

<p>The mere circumstance that Pindar gives us in three separate
passages, Κρίσᾳ, Κρισαῖον, Κρισαίοις (Isth. ii, 26; Pyth. v, 49, vi,
18), and in five other passages, Κίῤῥᾳ, Κίῤῥας, Κίῤῥαθεν (Pyth. iii,
33, vii, 14, viii, 26, x, 24, xi, 20), renders it almost certain that
the two names belong to different places, and are not merely two
different names for the same place; the poet could not in this case
have any metrical reason for varying the denomination, as the metre
of the two words is similar.</p>

<p id="Footnote_120"><span class="label"><a

Pythian games were celebrated in the autumn: M. Boeckh refers the
celebration to the spring: Krause agrees with Boeckh. (Clinton, Fast.
Hell. vol. ii, p. 200, Appendix; Boeckh, ad Corp. Inscr. No. 1688, p.
813; Krause, Die Pythien, Nemeen und Isthmien, vol. ii, pp. 29-35.)
</p>

<p>Mr. Clinton’s opinion appears to me nearly the truth; the real
time, as I conceive it, being about the beginning of August, or end
of July. Boeckh admits that, with the exception of Thucydidês (v,
1-19), the other authorities go to sustain it; but he relies on
Thucydidês to outweigh them. Now the passage of Thucydidês, properly
understood, seems to me as much against Boeckh’s view as the rest.
</p>

<p>I may remark, as a certain additional reason in the case, that
the Isthmia appear to have been celebrated in the third year of each
Olympiad, and in the spring (Krause, p. 187). It seems improbable
that these two great festivals should have come one immediately after
the other, which, nevertheless, must be supposed, if we adopt the
opinion of Boeckh and Krause.</p>

<p>The Pythian games would be sometimes a little earlier, sometimes
a little later, in consequence of the time of full moon: notice
being always sent round by the administrators beforehand of the
commencement of the sacred month. See the references in K. F.
Hermann, Lehrbuch der gottesdienstl. Alterth. der Griechen, ch.

<p>That the Kleônæans continued without interruption to administer
the Nemean festival down to Olympiad 80 (460 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>),
or thereabouts, is the rational inference from Pindar, Nem. x, 42:
compare Nem. iv, 17. Eusebius, indeed, states that the Argeians
seized the administration for themselves in Olympiad 53, and in
order to reconcile this statement with the above passage in Pindar,
critics have concluded that the Argeians lost it again, and that the
Kleônæans resumed it a little before Olympiad 80. I take a different
view, and am disposed to reject the statement of Eusebius altogether;
the more so as Pindar’s tenth Nemean ode is addressed to an Argeian
citizen named Theiæus. If there had been at that time a standing
dispute between Argos and Kleônæ on the subject of the administration
of the Nemea, the poet would hardly have introduced the mention of
the Nemean prizes gained by the ancestors of Theiæus, under the
untoward designation of “prizes received from Kleônæan men.”</p>

<p id="Footnote_125"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_125">[125]</a></span> K. F. Hermann, in his
Lehrbuch der Griechischen Staatsalterthümer (ch. 32, not. 7. and
ch. 65, not. 3), and again in his more recent work (Lehrbuch der
gottesdienstlichen Alterthümer der Griechen, part iii, ch. 49, also
not. 6), both highly valuable publications, maintains,—1. That
the exaltation of the Isthmian and Nemean games into Pan-Hellenic
importance arose directly after and out of the fall of the despots
of Corinth and Sikyon. 2. That it was brought about by the paramount
influence of the Dorians, especially by Sparta. 3. That the Spartans
put down the despots of both these two cities.</p>

<p>The last of these three propositions appears to me untrue in
respect to Sikyon,—improbable in respect to Corinth: my reasons for
thinking so have been given in a former chapter. And if this be so,
the reason for presuming Spartan intervention as to the Isthmian and
Nemean games falls to the ground; for there is no other proof of it,
nor does Sparta appear to have interested herself in any of the four
national festivals except the Olympic, with which she was from an
early period peculiarly connected.</p>

<p>Nor can I think that the first of Hermann’s three propositions is
at all tenable. No connection whatever can be shown between Sikyon
and the Nemean games; and it is the more improbable in this case that
the Sikyonians should have been active, inasmuch as they had under
Kleisthenês a little before contributed to nationalize the Pythian
games: a second interference for a similar purpose ought not to be
presumed without some evidence. To prove his point about the Isthmia,
Hermann cites only a passage of Solinus (vii, 14), “Hoc spectaculum,
per Cypselum tyrannum intermissum, Corinthii Olymp. 49 solemnitati
pristinæ reddiderunt.” To render this passage at all credible, we
must read <i>Cypselidas</i> instead of <i>Cypselum</i>, which deducts from the
value of a witness whose testimony can never under any circumstances
be rated high. But granting the alteration, there are two reasons
against the assertion of Solinus. One, a positive reason, that Solon
offered a large reward to Athenian victors at the Isthmian games: his
legislation falls in 594 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, ten years before the
time when the Isthmia are said by Solinus to have been renewed after
a long intermission. The other reason (negative, though to my mind
also powerful) is the silence of Herodotus in that long invective
which he puts into the mouth of Sosiklês against the Kypselids (v,
92). If Kypselus had really been guilty of so great an insult to the
feelings of the people as to suppress their most solemn festival,
the fact would hardly have been omitted in the indictment which
Sosiklês is made to urge against him. Aristotle, indeed, representing
Kypselus as a mild and popular despot, introduces a contrary view of
his character, which, if we admitted it, would of itself suffice to
negative the supposition that he had suppressed the Isthmia.</p>

a peculiarity of Grecian feeling, as distinguished from Roman, that
men of great station accounted it an honor to contend in the games:
see, as a specimen, Tacitus, Dialogus de Orator. c. 9. “Ac si in
Græciâ natus esses, ubi ludicras quoque artes exercere honestum est,
ac tibi Nicostrati robur Dii dedissent, non paterer immanes illos et
ad pugnam natos lacertos levitate jaculi vanescere.” Again, Cicero,
pro Flacco, c. 13, in his sarcastic style: “Quid si etiam occisus est
a piratis Adramyttenus, homo nobilis, cujus est fere nobis omnibus
nomen auditum, Atinas pugil, Olympionices? hoc est apud Græcos
(quoniam de corum <i>gravitate</i> dicimus) prope majus et gloriosius,

business was often discussed at these Games,—that diplomatists made
use of the intercourse for the purpose of detecting the secret
designs of states whom they suspected, and that the administering
state often practised manœuvres in respect to the obligations of
truce for the Hieromenia, or Holy Month.</p>

<p id="Footnote_144"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_144">[144]</a></span> For the whole subject of this
chapter, the eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth chapters
of O. Müller’s History of the Literature of Ancient Greece, wherein
the lyric poets are handled with greater length than consists with
the limits of this work, will be found highly valuable,—chapters
abounding in erudition and ingenuity, but not always within the
limits of the evidence.</p>

<p>The learned work of Ulrici (Geschichte der Griechischen
Poesie—<i>Lyrik</i>) is still more open to the same remark.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_145"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_145">[145]</a></span> These early innovators in
Grecian music, rhythm, metre, and poetry, belonging to the seventh
century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, were very imperfectly known, even
to those contemporaries of Plato and Aristotle who tried to get
together facts for a consecutive history of music. The treatise of
Plutarch, De Musicâ, shows what very contradictory statements he
found. He quotes from four different authors,—Herakleidês, Glaukus,
Alexander, and Aristoxenus, who by no means agreed in their series
of names and facts. The first three of them blend together mythe and
history; while even the Anagraphê or inscription at Sikyon, which
professed to give a continuous list of such poets and musicians as
had contended at the Sikyonian games, began with a large stock of
mythical names,—Amphion, Linus, Pierius, etc. (Plutarch, Music.
p. 1132.) Some authors, according to Plutarch (p. 1133), made the
great chronological mistake of placing Terpander as contemporary
with Hippônax; a proof how little of chronological evidence was then
accessible.</p>

<p>That Terpander was victor at the Spartan festival of the
Karneia, in 676 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, may well have been derived by
Hellanikus from the Spartan registers: the name of the Lesbian harper
Perikleitas, as having gained the same prize at some subsequent
period (Plutarch, De Mus. p. 1133), probably rests on the same
authority. That Archilochus was rather later than Terpander, and
Thalêtas rather later than Archilochus, was the statement of Glaukus
(Plutarch, De Mus. p. 1134). Klonas and Polymnêstus are placed later
than Terpander; Archilochus later than Klonas: Alkman is said to have
mentioned Polymnêstus in one of his songs (pp. 1133-1135). It can
hardly be true that Terpander gained <i>four</i> Pythian prizes, if the
festival was octennial prior to its reconstitution by the Amphiktyons
(p. 1132). Sakadas gained three Pythian prizes <i>after</i> that period,
when the festival was quadrennial (p. 1134).</p>

<p>Compare the confused indications in Pollux, iv, 65-66, 78-79. The
abstract given by Photius of certain parts of the Chrestomathia of
Proclus (published in Gaisford’s edition of Hephæstion, pp. 375-389),
is also extremely valuable, in spite of its brevity and obscurity,
about the lyric and choric poetry of Greece.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_146"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_146">[146]</a></span> The difference between Νόμος
and Μέλος appears in Plutarch, De Musicâ, p. 1132—Καὶ τὸν Τέρπανδρον,
κιθαρῳδικῶν ποιητὴν ὄντα νόμων, κατὰ νόμον ἕκαστον τοῖς ἔπεσι τοῖς
ἑαυτοῦ καὶ τοῖς Ὁμήρου μέλη περιτιθέντα, ᾅδειν ἐν τοῖς ἀγῶσι·
ἀποφῆναι δὲ τοῦτον λέγει ὀνόματα πρῶτον τοῖς κιθαρῳδικοῖς νόμοις.</p>

<p>The nomes were not many in number; they went by special names;
and there was a disagreement of opinion as to the persons who had
composed them (Plutarch, Music. p. 1133). They were monodic, not
choric,—intended to be sung by one person (Aristot. Problem. xix,
15). Herodot. i, 23, about Arion and the Nomus Orthius.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_147"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_147">[147]</a></span> Mr. Clinton (Fasti Hellen.
ad ann. 671, 665, 644) appears to me noway satisfactory in his
chronological arrangements of the poets of this century. I agree
with O. Müller (Hist. of Literat. of Ancient Greece, ch. xii, 9)
in thinking that he makes Terpander too recent, and Thalêtas too
ancient; I also believe both Kallinus and Alkman to have been more
recent than the place which Mr. Clinton assigns to them; the epoch
of Tyrtæus will depend upon the date which we assign to the second
Messenian war.</p>

<p>How very imperfectly the chronology of the poetical names
even of the sixth century <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>—Sappho, Anakreon,
Hippônax—was known even to writers of the beginning of the Ptolemaic
age (or shortly after 300 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), we may see by the
mistakes noted in Athenæus, xiii, p. 599. Hermesianax of Kolophon,
the elegiac poet, represented Anakreon as the lover of Sappho; this
might perhaps be not absolutely impossible, if we supposed in Sappho
an old age like that of Ninon de l’Enclos; but others (even earlier
than Hermesianax, since they are quoted by Chamæleon) represented
Anakreon, when in old age, as addressing verses to Sappho, still
young. Again, the comic writer Diphilus introduced both Archilochus
and Hippônax as the lovers of Sappho.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_148"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_148">[148]</a></span> The Latin poets and the
Alexandrine critics seem to have both insisted on the natural
mournfulness of the elegiac metre (Ovid, Heroid. xv, 7; Horat. Art.
Poet. 75): see also the fanciful explanation given by Didymus in the
Etymologicon Magnum, v. Ἔλεγος.</p>

<p>We learn from Hephæstion (c. viii, p. 45, Gaisf.) that the
anapæstic march-metre of Tyrtæus was employed by the comic writers
also, for a totally different vein of feeling. See the Dissertation
of Franck, Callinus, pp. 37-48 (Leips. 1816).</p>

<p>Of the remarks made by O. Müller respecting the metres of these
early poets (History of the Literature of Ancient Greece, ch. xi, s.
8-12, etc.; ch. xii, s. 1-2, etc.), many appear to be uncertified and
disputable.</p>

<p>For some good remarks on the fallibility of men’s impressions
respecting the natural and inherent ἦθος of particular metres, see
Adam Smith (Theory of Moral Sentiment, part v, ch. i, p. 329), in the
edition of his works by Dugald Stewart.</p>

of Pindar (i, 4), though I agree with Dr. Barham (in the valuable
Preface to his edition of Hephæstion, Cambridge, 1843, pp. 5-8) that
the opposite sense of the words would be the preferable one, just as
it was the original sense in which they were used by the best Greek
musical writers: Dr. Barham’s Preface is very instructive on the
difficult subject of ancient rhythm generally.</p>

consecrated practice, seemingly different festivals in different
places (Aristot. Politic. vii, 15, 8).</p>

<p>The reader will understand better what this consecrated
scurrility means by comparing the description of a modern traveller
in the kingdom of Naples (Tour through the Southern Provinces of the
Kingdom of Naples, by Mr. Keppel Craven, London, 1821, ch. xv, p.
287):—</p>

<p>“I returned to Gerace (the site of the ancient Epizephyrian
Lokri) by one of those moonlights which are known only in these
latitudes, and which no pen or pencil can portray. My path lay along
some cornfields, in which the natives were employed in the last
labors of the harvest, and I was not a little surprised to find
myself saluted with a volley of opprobrious epithets and abusive
language, uttered in the most threatening voice, and accompanied with
the most insulting gestures. This extraordinary custom is of the most
remote antiquity, and is observed towards all strangers during the
harvest and vintage seasons; those who are apprized of it will keep
their temper as well as their presence of mind, as the loss of either
would only serve as a signal for still louder invectives, and prolong
a contest in which success would be as hopeless as undesirable.”</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_152"><span class="label"><a

rhythmical and metrical changes introduced by Archilochus is to be

words very difficult to understand completely. See Ulrici, Geschichte
der Hellenisch. Poesie, vol. ii, p. 381.</p>

<p>Thiersch (Epochen der Bildenden Kunst, pp. 182-190, 2nd edit.)
places Rhœkus near the beginning of the recorded Olympiads; and
supposes two artists named Theodôrus, one the grandson of the other;
but this seems to me not sustained by any adequate authority (for the
loose chronology of Pliny about the Samian school of artists is not
more trustworthy than about the Chian school,—compare xxxv, 12, and
xxxvi, 3), and, moreover, intrinsically improbable. Herodotus (i,
51) speaks of “<i>the</i> Samian Theodôrus,” and seems to have known only
one person so called: Diodôrus (i, 98) and Pausanias (x, 38, 3) give
different accounts of Theodôrus, but the positive evidence does not
enable us to verify the genealogies either of Thiersch or O. Müller.
Herodotus (iv, 152) mentions the Ἡραῖον at Samos in connection
with events near Olymp. 37; but this does not prove that the great
temple which he himself saw, a century and a half later, had been
begun before Olymp. 37, as Thiersch would infer. The statement of O.

(v, 92). In this latter belief I cannot go along with him, nor do I

Πεισίστρατον. A later statement (Athenæus, xiii, p. 609) represents
Phyê to have become afterwards the wife of Hipparchus.</p>

<p>Of this remarkable story, not the least remarkable part is the
criticism with which Herodotus himself accompanies it. He treats
it as a proceeding infinitely silly (πρῆγμα εὐηθέστατον, ὡς ἐγὼ
εὐρίσκω, μακρῷ); he cannot conceive, how Greeks, so much superior
to barbarians,—and even Athenians, the cleverest of all the
Greeks,—could have fallen into such a trap. To him the story was told
as a deception from the beginning, and he did not perhaps take pains
to put himself into the state of feeling of those original spectators
who saw the chariot approach, without any warning or preconceived
suspicion. But even allowing for this, his criticism brings to our
view the alteration and enlargement which had taken place in the
Greek mind during the century between Peisistratus and Periklês.
Doubtless, neither the latter nor any of his contemporaries could
have succeeded in a similar trick.</p>

<p>The fact, and the criticism upon it, now before us are remarkably
illustrated by an analogous case recounted in a previous chapter,
(vol. ii, p. 421, chap. viii.) Nearly at the same period as this
stratagem of Peisistratus, the Lacedæmonians and the Argeians agreed
to decide, by a combat of three hundred select champions, the dispute
between them as to the territory of Kynuria. The combat actually
took place, and the heroism of Othryades, sole Spartan survivor, has
been already recounted. In the eleventh year of the Peloponnesian
war, shortly after or near upon the period when we may conceive the
history of Herodotus to have been finished, the Argeians concluded a
treaty with Lacedæmon, and introduced as a clause into it the liberty
of reviving their pretensions to Kynuria, and of again deciding the
dispute by a combat of select champions. To the Lacedæmonians of
that time this appeared extreme folly,—the very proceeding which had
been actually resorted to a century before. Here is another case, in
which the change in the point of view, and the increased positive
tendencies in the Greek mind, are brought to our notice not less
forcibly than by the criticism of Herodotus upon Phyê-Athênê.</p>

<p>Istrus (one of the Atthido-graphers of the third century
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>) and Antiklês published books respecting
the personal manifestations or epiphanies of the gods,—Ἀπόλλωνος
ἐπιφανεῖαι: see Istri Fragment. 33-37, ed. Didot. If Peisistratus
and Megaklês had never quarrelled, their joint stratagem might
have continued to pass for a genuine epiphany, and might have been
included as such in the work of Istrus. I will add, that the real
presence of the gods, at the festivals celebrated in their honor, was
an idea continually brought before the minds of the Greeks.</p>

<p>The Athenians fully believed the epiphany of the god Pan to
Pheidippidês the courier, on his march to Sparta, a little before the
battle of Marathôn (Herodot. vi, 105, καὶ ταῦτα Ἀθηναῖοι πιστεύσαντες
εἶναι ἀληθέα), and even Herodotus himself does not controvert it,
though he relaxes the positive character of history so far as to
add—“as Pheidippidês himself said and recounted publicly to the
Athenians.” His informants in this case were doubtless sincere
believers; whereas, in the case of Phyê, the story was told to him at
first as a fabrication.</p>

<p>At Gela in Sicily, seemingly not long before this restoration
of Peisistratus, Têlinês (ancestor of the despot Gelon) had brought
back some exiles to Gela, “without any armed force, but merely
through the sacred ceremonies and appurtenances of the subterranean
goddesses,”—ἔχων οὐδεμίην ἀνδρῶν δύναμιν, ἀλλ᾽ ἱρὰ τουτέων τῶν
θεῶν—τούτοισι δ᾽ ὦν πίσυνος ἐὼν, κατήγαγε (Herodot. vii, 153).
Herodotus does not tell us the details which he had heard of the
manner in which this restoration at Gela was brought about; but his
general language intimates, that they were remarkable details, and
they might have illustrated the story of Phyê Athênê.</p>

Dr. Arnold, and Dr. Thirlwall, that Peisistratus had levied a tythe
or tax of ten per cent., and that his sons reduced it to the half,
I find no sufficient warrant: certainly, the spurious letter of
Peisistratus to Solon in Diogenes Laërtius (i, 53) ought not to be
considered as proving anything. Boeckh, Public Economy of Athens,
B. iii, c. 6 (i, 351 German); Dr. Arnold ad Thucyd. vi, 34; Dr.
Thirlwall Hist. of Gr. ch. xi, pp. 72-74. Idomeneus (ap. Athenæ.
xii, p. 533) considers the sons of Peisistratus to have indulged in
pleasures to an extent more costly and oppressive to the people than
their father. Nor do I think that there is sufficient authority to
sustain the statement of Dr. Thirlwall (p. 68), “He (Peisistratus)
possessed lands on the Strymon in Thrace, which yielded a large
revenue.” Herodotus (i, 64) tells us that Peisistratus brought
mercenary soldiers from the Strymon, but that he levied the money to
pay them in Attica—ἐῤῥίζωσε τὴν τυραννίδα ἐπικούροισί τε πολλοῖσι,
καὶ χρημάτων συνόδοισι, τῶν μὲν αὐτόθεν, τῶν δὲ ἀπὸ Στρύμονος ποταμοῦ
συνιόντων. It is, indeed, possible to construe this passage so as
to refer both τῶν μὲν and τῶν δὲ to χρημάτων, which would signify
that Peisistratus obtained his funds partly from the river Strymon,
and thus serve as basis to the statement of Dr. Thirlwall. But it
seems to me that the better way of construing the words is to refer
τῶν μὲν to χρημάτων συνόδοισι, and τῶν δὲ to ἐπικούροισι,—treating
both of them as genitives absolute. It is highly improbable that he
should derive money from the Strymon: it is highly probable that his
mercenaries came from thence.</p>

Thucydidês was connected by relationship with the Peisistratidæ.
His manner of speaking of them certainly lends countenance to the
assertion; not merely as he twice notices their history, once
briefly (i, 20) and again at considerable length (vi, 54-59),
though it does not lie within the direct compass of his period,—but
also as he so emphatically announces his own personal knowledge of
their family relations,—Ὅτι δὲ πρεσβύτατος ὢν Ἱππίας ἦρξεν, <span

general belief of the Athenian public in his time—Ἀθηναίων γοῦν τὸ

<p>The Pseudo-Plato in the dialogue called Hipparchus adopts this
belief, and the real Plato in his Symposion (c. 9, p. 182) seems to
countenance it.</p>

Ἁρμόδιον ἀπαρνηθέντα τὴν πείρασιν, ὥσπερ διενοεῖτο, προυπηλάκισεν·
ἀδελφὴν γὰρ αὐτοῦ, κόρην, ἐπαγγείλαντες ἥκειν κανοῦν οἴσουσαν ἐν

<p>Dr. Arnold, in his note, supposes that this exclusion of the
sister of Harmodius by the Peisistratids may have been founded on
the circumstance that she belonged to the gens Gephyræi (Herodot. v,
57); her foreign blood, and her being in certain respects ἄτιμος,
disqualified her (he thinks) from ministering to the worship of the
gods of Athens.</p>

<p>There is no positive reason to support the conjecture of Dr.
Arnold, which seems, moreover, virtually discountenanced by the
narrative of Thucydidês, who plainly describes the treatment of this
young woman as a deliberate, preconcerted insult. Had there existed
any assignable ground of exclusion, such as that which Dr. Arnold
supposes, leading to the inference that the Peisistratids could not
admit her without violating religious custom, Thucydidês would hardly
have neglected to allude to it, for it would have lightened the
insult; and indeed, on that supposition, the sending of the original
summons might have been made to appear as an accidental mistake. I
will add, that Thucydidês, though no way forfeiting his obligations
to historical truth, is evidently not disposed to omit anything which
can be truly said in favor of the Peisistratids.</p>

σημαίνει, καὶ ἡ στήλη περὶ τῆς τῶν τυράννων ἀδικίας, ἡ ἐν τῇ Ἀθηναίων
ἀκροπόλει σταθεῖσα.</p>

<p>Dr. Thirlwall, after mentioning the departure of Hippias,
proceeds as follows: “After his departure many severe measures
were taken against his adherents, who appear to have been for a
long time afterwards a formidable party. They were punished or
repressed, some by death, others by exile or by the loss of their
political privileges. The family of the tyrants was condemned to
perpetual banishment, and appears to have been excepted from the most
comprehensive decrees of amnesty passed in later times.” (Hist. of
Gr. ch. xi, vol. ii, p. 81.)</p>

<p>I cannot but think that Dr. Thirlwall has here been misled by
insufficient authority. He refers to the oration of Andokidês de
Mysteriis, sects. 106 and 78 (sect. 106 coincides in part with ch.
18, in the ed. of Dobree). An attentive reading of it will show
that it is utterly unworthy of credit in regard to matters anterior
to the speaker by one generation or more. The orators often permit
themselves great license in speaking of past facts, but Andokidês in
this chapter passes the bounds even of rhetorical license. First,
he states something not bearing the least analogy to the narrative
of Herodotus as to the circumstances preceding the expulsion of the
Peisistratids, and indeed tacitly setting aside that narrative; next,
he actually jumbles together the two capital and distinct exploits of
Athens,—the battle of Marathon and the repulse of Xerxês ten years
after it. I state this latter charge in the words of Sluiter and
Valckenaer, before I consider the former charge: “Verissime ad hæc
verba notat Valckenaerius—Confundere videtur Andocidês diversissima;
Persica sub Miltiade et Dario et victoriam Marathoniam (v, 14)—quæque
evenere sub Themistocle, Xerxis gesta. Hic urbem incendio delevit,
non ille (v, 20). Nihil magis manifestum est, quam diversa ab oratore
confundi.” (Sluiter, Lection. Andocideæ, p. 147.)</p>

<p>The criticism of these commentators is perfectly borne out by the
words of the orator, which are too long to find a place here. But
immediately prior to those words he expresses himself as follows,
and this is the passage which serves as Dr. Thirlwall’s authority:
Οἱ γὰρ πατέρες οἱ ὑμέτεροι, γενομένων τῇ πόλει κακῶν μεγάλων, ὅτε
οἱ τύραννοι εἶχον τὴν πόλιν, ὁ δὲ δῆμος ἔφυγε, νικήσαντες μαχόμενοι
τοὺς τυράννους ἐπὶ Παλληνίῳ, στρατηγοῦντος Λεωγόρου τοῦ προπάππου τοῦ
ἐμοῦ, καὶ Χαρίου οὗ ἐκεῖνος τὴν θυγατέρα εἶχεν ἐξ ἧς ὁ ἡμέτερος ἦν
πάππος, κατελθόντες εἰς τὴν πατρίδα τοὺς μὲν ἀπέκτειναν, τῶν δὲ φυγὴν
κατέγνωσαν, τοὺς δὲ μένειν ἐν τῇ πόλει ἐάσαντες ἠτίμωσαν.</p>

<p>Both Sluiter (Lect. And. p. 8) and Dr. Thirlwall (Hist. p. 80)
refer this alleged victory of Leogoras and the Athenian demus to
the action described by Herodotus (v, 64) as having been fought by
Kleomenês of Sparta against the Thessalian cavalry. But the two
events have not a single circumstance in common, except that each
is a victory over the Peisistratidæ or their allies: nor could they
well be the same event, described in different terms, seeing that
Kleomenês, marching from Sparta to Athens, could not have fought
the Thessalians at Pallênê, which lay on the road from <i>Marathon</i>
to Athens. Pallênê was the place where Peisistratus, advancing from
Marathon to Athens, on occasion of his second restoration, gained his
complete victory over the opposing party, and marched on afterwards
to Athens without farther resistance (Herodot. i, 63).</p>

<p>If, then, we compare the statement given by Andokidês of the
preceding circumstances, whereby the dynasty of the Peisistratids was
put down, with that given by Herodotus, we shall see that the two are
radically different; we cannot blend them together, but must make our
election between them. Not less different are the representations of
the two as to the circumstances which immediately ensued on the fall
of Hippias: they would scarcely appear to relate to the same event.
That “the adherents of the Peisistratidæ were punished or repressed,
some by death, others by exile, or by the loss of their political
privileges,” which is the assertion of Andokidês and Dr. Thirlwall,
is not only not stated by Herodotus, but is highly improbable, if we
accept the facts which he does state; for he tells us that Hippias
capitulated and agreed to retire while possessing ample means of
resistance,—simply from regard to the safety of his children. It
is not to be supposed that he would leave his intimate partisans
exposed to danger; such of them as felt themselves obnoxious would
naturally retire along with him; and if this be what is meant by
“many persons condemned to exile,” here is no reason to call it in
question. But there is little probability that any one was put to
death, and still less probability that any were punished by the loss
of their political privileges. Within a year afterwards came the
comprehensive constitution of Kleisthenês, to be described in the <a
href="#Chap_31">following chapter</a>, and I consider it eminently
unlikely that there were a considerable class of residents in Attica
left out of this constitution, under the category of partisans of
Peisistratus: indeed, the fact cannot be so, if it be true that the
very first person banished under the Kleisthenean ostracism was a
person named Hipparchus, a kinsman of Peisistratus (Androtion, Fr. 5,
ed. Didot; Harpokration, v. Ἵππαρχος); and this latter circumstance
depends upon evidence better than that of Andokidês. That there were
a party in Attica attached to the Peisistratids, I do not doubt; but
that they were “a powerful party,” (as Dr. Thirlwall imagines,) I see
nothing to show; and the extraordinary vigor and unanimity of the
Athenian people under the Kleisthenean constitution will go far to
prove that such could not have been the case.</p>

<p>I will add another reason to evince how completely
Andokidês misconceives the history of Athens between 510-480
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> He says that when the Peisistratids were
put down, many of their partisans were banished, many others allowed
to stay at home with the loss of their political privileges; but that
afterwards, when the overwhelming dangers of the Persian invasion
supervened, the people passed a vote to restore the exiles and to
remove the existing disfranchisements at home. He would thus have
us believe that the exiled partisans of the Peisistratids were all
restored, and the disfranchised partisans of the Peisistratids
all enfranchised, just at the moment of the Persian invasion,
and with the view of enabling Athens better to repel that grave
danger. This is nothing less than a glaring mistake; for the
first Persian invasion was undertaken with the express view of
restoring Hippias, and with the presence of Hippias himself at
Marathon; while the second Persian invasion was also brought on in
part by the instigation of his family. Persons who had remained
in exile or in a state of disfranchisement down to that time, in
consequence of their attachment to the Peisistratids, could not
in common prudence be called into action at the moment of peril,
to help in repelling Hippias himself. It is very true that the
exiles and the disfranchised were readmitted, shortly before the
invasion of Xerxês, and under the then pressing calamities of the
state. But these persons were not philo-Peisistratids; they were a
number gradually accumulated from the sentences of exile and (atimy
or) disfranchisement every year passed at Athens,—for these were
punishments applied by the Athenian law to various crimes and public
omissions,—the persons so sentenced were not politically disaffected,
and their aid would then be of use in defending the state against a
foreign enemy.</p>

<p>In regard to “the exception of the family of Peisistratus from
the most comprehensive decrees of amnesty passed in later times,” I
will also remark that, in the decree of amnesty, there is no mention
of them by name, nor any special exception made against them: among a
list of various categories excepted, those are named “who have been
condemned to death or exile either as murderers or as despots,” (ἢ
σφαγεῦσιν ἢ τυράννοις, Andokid. c. 13.) It is by no means certain
that the <i>descendants</i> of Peisistratus would be comprised in this
exception, which mentions only the person himself condemned; but
even if this were otherwise, the exception is a mere continuance
of similar words of exception in the old Solonian law, anterior to
Peisistratus; and, therefore, affords no indication of particular
feeling against the Peisistratids.</p>

<p>Andokidês is a useful authority for the politics of Athens in his
own time (between 420-390 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>), but in regard to the
previous history of Athens between 510-480 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, his
assertions are so loose, confused, and unscrupulous, that he is a
witness of no value. The mere circumstance noted by Valckenaer, that
he has confounded together Marathon and Salamis, would be sufficient
to show this; but when we add to such genuine ignorance his mention
of his two great-grandfathers in prominent and victorious leadership,
which it is hardly credible that they could ever have occupied,—when
we recollect that the facts which he alleges to have preceded and
accompanied the expulsion of the Peisistratids are not only at
variance with those stated by Herodotus, but so contrived as to found
a factitious analogy for the cause which he is himself pleading,—we
shall hardly be able to acquit him of something worse than ignorance
in his deposition.</p>

<p>Several able critics, and Dr. Thirlwall among the number,
consider this passage as affording no sense, and assume some
conjectural emendation to be indispensable; though there is no

plausible. Under these circumstances, I rather prefer to make the
best of the words as they stand; which, though unusual, seem to me
not absolutely inadmissible. The expression ξένος μέτοικος (which
is a perfectly good one, as we find in Aristoph. Equit. 347,—εἴπου
δικιδίον εἶπας εὖ κατὰ ξένου μετοίκου) may be considered as the
correlative to δούλους μετοίκους,—the last word being construed both
with δούλους and with ξένους. I apprehend that there always must have
been in Attica a certain number of intelligent slaves living apart
from their masters (χωρὶς οἰκοῦντες), in a state between slavery
and freedom, working partly on condition of a fixed payment to him,
partly for themselves, and perhaps continuing to pass nominally as
slaves after they had bought their liberty by instalments. Such men
would be δοῦλοι μέτοικοι: indeed, there are cases in which δοῦλοι
signifies <i>freedmen</i> (Meier, De Gentilitate Atticâ, p. 6): they
must have been industrious and pushing men, valuable partisans to a
political revolution. See K. F. Hermann, Lehrbuch der Griech. Staats

<p>Schömann contends that Kleisthenês established exactly one
hundred demes to the ten tribes (De Comitiis Atheniensium, Præf. p.
xv and p. 363, and Antiquitat. Jur. Pub. Græc. ch. xxii, p. 260), and
K. F. Hermann (Lehrbuch der Griech. Staats Alt. ch. 111) thinks that
this is what Herodotus meant to affirm, though he does not believe
the fact to have really stood so.</p>

<p>I incline, as the least difficulty in the case, to construe δέκα
with φυλὰς and not with δήμους, as Wachsmuth (i, 1, p. 271) and
Dieterich (De Clisthene, a treatise cited by K. F. Hermann, but which
I have not seen) construe it.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_250"><span class="label"><a

the tribe Kekropis; <i>Kollytus</i>, to the tribe Ægêis; <i>Kydathenæon</i>, to
the tribe Pandionis; <i>Kerameis</i> or <i>Kerameikus</i>, to the Akamantis;
<i>Skambônidæ</i>, to the Leontis.</p>

<p>All these five were demes within the city of Athens, and all
belonged to different tribes.</p>

<p><i>Peiræus</i> belonged to the Hippothoöntis; <i>Phalêrum</i>, to the
Æantis; <i>Xypetê</i>, to the Kekropis; <i>Thymætadæ</i>, to the Hippothoöntis.
These four demes, adjoining to each other, formed a sort of quadruple
local union, for festivals and other purposes, among themselves;
though three of them belonged to different tribes.</p>

<p>See the list of the Attic demes, with a careful statement of
their localities in so far as ascertained, in Professor Ross, Die
Demen von Attika. Halle, 1846. The distribution of the city-demes,
and of Peiræus and Phalêrum, among different tribes, appears to me a
clear proof of the intention of the original distributors. It shows
that they wished from the beginning to make the demes constituting
each tribe discontinuous, and that they desired to prevent both the
growth of separate tribe-interests and ascendency of one tribe over
the rest. It contradicts the belief of those who suppose that the
tribe was at first composed of continuous demes, and that the breach
of continuity arose from subsequent changes.</p>

<p>Of course there were many cases in which adjoining demes belonged
to the same tribe; but not one of the ten tribes was made up
altogether of adjoining demes.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_260"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_260">[260]</a></span> Aristotle puts these two
together; election of magistrates by the mass of the citizens, but
only out of persons possessing a high pecuniary qualification;
this he ranks as the least democratical democracy, if one may
use the phrase (Politic. iii, 6-11), or a mean between democracy
and oligarchy,—an ἀριστοκρατία, or πολιτεῖα, in his sense of the
word (iv, 7, 3). He puts the employment of the lot as a symptom
of decisive and extreme democracy, such as would never tolerate a
pecuniary qualification of eligibility.</p>

<p>So again Plato (Legg. iii, p. 692), after remarking that the
legislator of Sparta first provided the senate, next the ephors, as a
bridle upon the kings, says of the ephors that they were “something
nearly approaching to an authority emanating from the lot,”—οἷον
ψάλιον ἐνέβαλεν αὐτῇ τὴν τῶν ἐφόρων δύναμιν, ἐγγὺς τῆς κληρωτῆς
ἀγαγὼν δυνάμεως.</p>

<p>Upon which passage there are some good remarks in Schömann’s
edition of Plutarch’s Lives of Agis and Kleomenês (Comment. ad Ag.
c. 8, p. 119). It is to be recollected that the actual mode in which
the Spartan ephors were chosen, as I have already stated in my first
volume, cannot be clearly made out, and has been much debated by
critics:—</p>

<p>“Mihi hæc verba, quum illud quidem manifestum faciant, quod
etiam aliunde constat, sorte captos ephoros non esse, tum hoc
alterum, quod Hermannus statuit, creationem sortitioni non absimilem
fuisse, nequaquam demonstrare videntur. Nimirum nihil aliud nisi
prope accedere ephororum magistratus ad cos dicitur, qui sortito
capiantur. <i>Sortitis autem magistratibus hoc maxime proprium est,
ut promiscue—non ex genere, censu, dignitate—a quolibet capi
possint</i>: quamobrem quum ephori quoque fere promiscue fierent ex omni
multitudine civium, poterat haud dubie magistratus eorum ἐγγὺς τῆς
κληρωτῆς δυνάμεως esse dici, etiamsi αἱρετοὶ essent—h. e. suffragiis
creati. Et video Lachmannum quoque, p. 165, not. 1, de Platonis loco
similiter judicare.”</p>

<p>The employment of the lot, as Schömann remarks, implies universal
admissibility of all citizens to office: though the converse does not
hold good,—the latter does not of necessity imply the former. Now,
as we know that universal admissibility did not become the law of
Athens until after the battle of Platæa, so we may conclude that the
employment of the lot had no place before that epoch,—<i>i. e.</i> had no
place under the constitution of Kleisthenês.</p>

<p id="Footnote_266"><span class="label"><a

of the twelfth and thirteenth century, the nobles long continued to
possess the exclusive right of being elected to the consulate and
the great offices of state, even after those offices had come to be
elected by the people: the habitual misrule and oppression of the
nobles gradually put an end to this right, and even created in many
towns a resolution positively to exclude them. At Milan, towards the
end of the twelfth century, the twelve consuls, with the Podestat,
possessed all the powers of government: these consuls were nominated
by one hundred electors chosen by and among the people. Sismondi
observes: “Cependant le peuple imposa lui-même a ces électeurs, la
règle fondamentale de choisir tous les magistrats dans le corps de
la noblesse. Ce n’étoit point encore la possession des magistratures
que l’on contestoit aux gentilshommes: on demandoit seulement qu’ils
fussent les mandataires immédiats de la nation. Mais plus d’une fois,
en dépit du droit incontestable des citoyens, les consuls regnant
s’attribuèrent l’élection de leurs successeurs.” (Sismondi, Histoire
des Républiques Italiennes, chap. xii, vol. ii, p. 240.)</p>

<p id="Footnote_268"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_268">[268]</a></span> Herodotus speaks of Kallimachus
the Polemarch, at Marathon, as ὁ τῷ κυάμῳ λαχὼν Πολέμαρχος (vi, 110).
</p>

<p>I cannot but think that in this case he transfers to the year 490
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> the practice of his own time. The polemarch,
at the time of the battle of Marathon, was in a certain sense the
first stratêgus; and the stratêgi were never taken by lot, but always
chosen by show of hands, even to the end of the democracy. It seems
impossible to believe that the stratêgi were elected, and that the
polemarch, at the time when his functions were the same as theirs,
was chosen by lot.</p>

<p>Herodotus seems to have conceived the choice of magistrates by
lot as being of the essence of a democracy (Herodot. iii, 80).</p>

<p>Plutarch also (Periklês, c. 9) seems to have conceived the
choice of archons by lot as a very ancient institution of Athens:
nevertheless, it results from the first chapter of his life of
Aristeidês,—an obscure chapter, in which conflicting authorities
are mentioned without being well discriminated,—that Aristeidês was
<i>chosen archon by the people</i>,—not drawn by lot: an additional reason
for believing this is, that he was archon in the year following the
battle of Marathon, at which, he had been one of the ten generals.
Idomeneus distinctly affirmed this to be the fact.—οὐ κυαμευτὸν, ἀλλ᾽
ἑλομένων Ἀθηναίων (Plutarch, Arist. c. 1).</p>

<p>Isokratês also (Areopagit. Or. vii, p. 144, p. 195, ed. Bekker)
conceived the constitution of Kleisthenês as including all the three
points noticed in the text: 1. A high pecuniary qualification of
eligibility for individual offices. 2. Election to these offices by
all the citizens, and accountability to the same after office. 3. No
employment of the lot.—He even contends that this election is more
truly democratical than sortition; since the latter process might
admit men attached to oligarchy, which would not happen under the
former,—ἔπειτα καὶ δημοτικωτέραν ἐνόμιζον ταύτην τὴν κατάστασιν ἢ
τὴν διὰ τοῦ λαγχάνειν γιγνομένην· ἐν μὲν γὰρ τῇ κληρώσει τὴν τύχην
βραβεύσειν, καὶ πολλάκις λήψεσθαι τὰς ἀρχὰς τοὺς τῆς ὀλιγαρχίας
ἐπιθυμοῦντας, etc. This would be a good argument if there were no
pecuniary qualification for eligibility,—such pecuniary qualification
is a provision which he lays down, but which he does not find it
convenient to insist upon emphatically.</p>

<p>I do not here advert to the γραφὴ παρανόμων, the νομοφύλακες, and
the sworn νομόθεται,—all of them institutions belonging to the time
of Periklês at the earliest; not to that of Kleisthenês.</p>

Alkibiad. c. 13; Aristeid. c. 7): Thucyd. viii, 73. Plato Comicus
said, respecting Hyperbolus—</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="i0">Οὐ γὰρ τοιούτων οὕνεκ᾽ ὄστραχ᾽ ηὑρέθη.</p>
</div></div>

<p class="mt1"> Theophrastus had stated that Phæax, and not Nikias,
was the rival of Alkibiadês on this occasion, when Hyperbolus was
ostracized; but most authors, says Plutarch, represent Nikias as
the person. It is curious that there should be any difference of
statement about a fact so notorious, and in the best-known time of
Athenian history.</p>

<p>Taylor thinks that the oration which now passes as that of
Andokidês against Alkibiadês, is really by Phæax, and was read by
Plutarch as the oration of Phæax in an actual contest of ostracism
between Phæax, Nikias, and Alkibiadês. He is opposed by Ruhnken
and Valckenaer (see Sluiter’s preface to that oration, c. 1, and
Ruhnken, Hist. Critic. Oratt. Græcor. p. 135). I cannot agree with
either: I cannot think with him, that it is a real oration of Phæax;
nor with them, that it is a real oration in any genuine cause of
ostracism whatever. It appears to me to have been composed after
the ostracism had fallen into desuetude, and when the Athenians had
not only become somewhat ashamed of it, but had lost the familiar
conception of what it really was. For how otherwise can we explain
the fact, that the author of that oration complains that he is about
to be ostracized without any secret voting, in which the very essence
of the ostracism consisted, and from which its name was borrowed
(οὔτε διαψηφισαμένων κρυβδὴν, c. 2)? His oration is framed as if
the audience whom he was addressing were about to ostracize one
out of the three, by show of hands. But the process of ostracizing
included no meeting and haranguing,—nothing but simple deposit of the
shells in a cask; as may be seen by the description of the special
railing-in of the agora, and by the story (true or false) of the
unlettered country-citizen coming into the city to give his vote,
and asking Aristeidês, without even knowing his person, to write the
name for him on the shell (Plutarch, Aristeid. c. 7). There was,
indeed, previous discussion in the senate as well as in the ekklesia,
whether a vote of ostracism should be entered upon at all; but the
author of the oration to which I allude does not address himself to
<i>that</i> question; he assumes that the vote is actually about to be
taken, and that one of the three—himself, Nikias, or Alkibiadês—must
be ostracized (c. 1). Now, doubtless, in practice, the decision
commonly lay between two formidable rivals; but it was not publicly
or formally put so before the people: every citizen might write upon
the shell such name as he chose. Farther, the open denunciation of
the injustice of ostracism as a system (c. 2), proves an age later
than the banishment of Hyperbolus. Moreover, the author having
begun by remarking that he stands in contest with Nikias as well as
with Alkibiadês, says nothing more about Nikias to the end of the
speech.</p>

<p>It would rather appear by that passage that the ostracism was
never formally abrogated; and that even in the later times, to which
the description of Aristotle refers, the form was still preserved
of putting the question whether the public safety called for an
ostracizing vote, long after it had passed both out of use and out of
mind.</p>

Plutarch, Aristeid. c. 7; Schol. ad Aristophan. Equit. 851; Pollux,
viii, 19.</p>

<p>There is a difference of opinion among the authorities, as
well as among the expositors, whether the minimum of six thousand
applies to the votes given in all, or to the votes given against
any one name. I embrace the latter opinion, which is supported by
Philochorus, Pollux, and the Schol. on Aristophanês, though Plutarch
countenances the former. Boeckh, in his Public Economy of Athens, and
Wachsmuth, (i, 1, p. 272) are in favor of Plutarch and the former
opinion; Paradys (Dissertat. De Ostr. p. 25), Platner, and Hermann
(see K. F. Hermann, Lehrbuch der Gr. Staatsalt. ch. 130, not. 6)
support the other, which appears to me the right one.</p>

<p>For the purpose, so unequivocally pronounced, of the general
law determining the absolute minimum necessary for a <i>privilegium</i>,
would by no means be obtained, if the simple majority of votes,
among six thousand voters in all, had been allowed to take effect.
A person might then be ostracized with a very small number of votes
against him, and without creating any reasonable presumption that
he was dangerous to the constitution; which was by no means either
the purpose of Kleisthenês, or the well-understood operation of the
ostracism, so long as it continued to be a reality.</p>

<p id="Footnote_279"><span class="label"><a

ostracism presents it as a struggle between two contending leaders,
accompanied with chance of banishment to both—Periklês πρὸς τὸν
Θουκυδίδην εἰς ἀγῶνα περὶ τοῦ ὀστράκου καταστὰς, καὶ διακινδυνεύσας,
ἐκεῖνον μὲν ἐξέβαλε, κατέλυσε δὲ τὴν ἀντιτεταγμένην ἑταιρείαν

<p id="Footnote_280"><span class="label"><a

remark to take notice, either of the oligarchy of Four Hundred, or
that of Thirty, called the Thirty Tyrants, established during the
closing years of the Peloponnesian war, and after the ostracism had
been discontinued. Neither of these changes were brought about by the
excessive ascendency of any one or few men: both of them grew out of
the embarrassments and dangers of Athens in the latter period of her
great foreign war.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_281"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_281">[281]</a></span> Aristotle (Polit. iii, 8, 6)
seems to recognize the political necessity of the ostracism, as
applied even to obvious superiority of wealth, connection, etc.
(which he distinguishes pointedly from superiority of merit and
character), and upon principles of symmetry only, even apart from
dangerous designs on the part of the superior mind. No painter, he
observes, will permit a foot, in his picture of a man, to be of
disproportionate size with the entire body, though separately taken
it may be finely painted; nor will the chorus-master allow any one
voice, however beautiful, to predominate beyond a certain proportion
over the rest.</p>

<p>His final conclusion is, however, that the legislator ought,
if possible, so to construct his constitution, as to have no need
of such exceptional remedy; but, if this cannot be done, then the
second-best step is to apply the ostracism. Compare also v, 2, 5.</p>

<p>The last century of the free Athenian democracy realized the
first of these alternatives.</p>

<p id="Footnote_296"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_296">[296]</a></span> Herodot. vi, 108. Thucydidês
(iii, 58), when recounting the capture of Platæa by the Lacedæmonians
in the third year of the Peloponnesian war, states that the alliance
between Platæa and Athens was then in its 93rd year of date;
according to which reckoning it would begin in the year 519 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, where Mr. Clinton and other chronologers place it.</p>

<p>I venture to think that the immediate circumstances, as recounted
in the text from Herodotus (whether Thucydidês conceived them in the
same way, cannot be determined), which brought about the junction
of Platæa with Athens, cannot have taken place in 519 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, but must have happened <i>after</i> the expulsion of Hippias
from Athens in 510 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,—for the following reasons:—
</p>

<p>1. No mention is made of Hippias, who yet, if the event had
happened in 519 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, must have been the person
to determine whether the Athenians should assist Platæa or not.
The Platæan envoys present themselves at a public sacrifice in the
attitude of suppliants, so as to touch the feelings of the Athenian
citizens generally: had Hippias been then despot, <i>he</i> would have
been the person to be propitiated and to determine for or against
assistance.</p>

<p>2. We know no cause which should have brought Kleomenês with
a Lacedæmonian force near to Platæa in the year 519 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>: we know from the statement of Herodotus (v, 76) that no
Lacedæmonian expedition against Attica took place at that time. But
in the year to which I have referred the event, Kleomenês is on his
march near the spot upon a known and assignable object. From the very
tenor of the narrative, it is plain that Kleomenês and his army were
not designedly in Bœotia, nor meddling with Bœotian affairs, at the
time when the Platæans solicited his aid; he declines to interpose in
the matter, pleading the great distance between Sparta and Platæa as
a reason.</p>

<p>3. Again, Kleomenês, in advising the Platæans to solicit Athens,
does not give the advice through good-will towards them, but through
a desire to harass and perplex the Athenians, by entangling them in
a quarrel with the Bœotians. At the point of time to which I have
referred the incident, this was a very natural desire: he was angry,
and perhaps alarmed, at the recent events which had brought about his
expulsion from Athens. But what was there to make him conceive such a
feeling against Athens during the reign of Hippias? That despot was
on terms of the closest intimacy with Sparta: the Peisistratids were
(ξείνους—ξεινίους ταμάλιστα—Herod. v, 63, 90, 91) “the particular
guests” of the Spartans, who were only induced to take part against
Hippias from a reluctant obedience to the oracles procured, one
after another, by Kleisthenês. The motive, therefore, assigned by
Herodotus, for the advice given by Kleomenês to the Platæans, can
have no application to the time when Hippias was still despot.</p>

<p>4. That Herodotus did not conceive the victory gained by the
Athenians over Thebes as having taken place <i>before</i> the expulsion
of Hippias, is evident from his emphatic contrast between their
warlike spirit and success when liberated from the despots, and
their timidity or backwardness while under Hippias (Ἀθηναῖοι
τυραννευόμενοι μὲν, οὐδαμῶν τῶν σφέας περιοικεόντων ἔσαν τὰ πολέμια
ἀμείνους, ἀπαλλαχθέντες δὲ τυράννων, μακρῷ πρῶτοι ἐγένοντο· δηλοῖ
ὦν ταῦτα, ὅτι κατεχόμενοι μὲν, ἐθελοκάκεον, etc. v, 78). The man
who wrote thus cannot have believed that, in the year 519 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, while Hippias was in full sway, the Athenians gained an
important victory over the Thebans, cut off a considerable portion
of the Theban territory for the purpose of joining it to that of
the Platæans, and showed from that time forward their constant
superiority over Thebes by protecting her inferior neighbor against
her.</p>

<p>These different reasons, taking them altogether, appear to me to
show that the first alliance between Athens and Platæa, as Herodotus
conceives and describes it, cannot have taken place before the
expulsion of Hippias, in 510 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>; and induce me to
believe, either that Thucydidês was mistaken in the date of that
event, or that Herodotus has not correctly described the facts. Not
seeing any reason to suspect the description given by the latter, I
have departed, though unwillingly, from the date of Thucydidês.</p>

<p>The application of the Platæans to Kleomenês, and his advice
grounded thereupon, may be connected more suitably with his first
expedition to Athens, after the expulsion of Hippias, than with his
second.</p>

<p id="Footnote_301"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_301">[301]</a></span> In the expression of Herodotus,
the Æakid heroes are <i>really</i> sent from Ægina, and <i>really</i> sent
back by the Thebans (v, 80-81)—Οἱ δέ σφι αἰτέουσι ἐπικουρίην τοὺς
Αἰακίδας συμπέμπειν ἔφασαν, αὖτις οἱ Θηβαῖοι πέμψαντες, <span
class="gesperrt">τοὺς μὲν Αἰακίδας σφι ἀπεδίδοσαν, τῶν δὲ ἀνδρῶν
ἐδέοντο</span>. Compare again v, 75; viii, 64; and Polyb. vii, 9, 2.
θεῶν τῶν συστρατευομένων.</p>

<p>Justin gives a narrative of an analogous application from the
Epizephyrian Lokrians to Sparta (xx, 3): “Territi Locrenses ad
Spartanos decurrunt: auxilium supplices deprecantur: illi longinquâ
militiâ gravati, auxilium a Castore et Polluce petere eos jubent.
Neque legati responsum sociæ urbis spreverunt; profectique in
proximum templum, facto sacrificio, auxilium deorum implorant.
Litatis hostiis, <i>obtentoque, ut rebantur, quod petebant—haud secus
læti quam si deos ipsos secum avecturi essent</i>—pulvinaria iis in navi
componunt, faustisque profecti ominibus, <i>solatia suis pro auxiliis</i>
deportant.” In comparing the expressions of Herodotus with those of
Justin, we see that the former believes the direct literal presence
and action of the Æakid heroes (“the Thebans sent back the heroes,
and asked for men”), while the latter explains away the divine
intervention into a mere fancy and feeling on the part of those to
whom it is supposed to be accorded. This was the tone of those later
authors whom Justin followed: compare also Pausan. iii, 19, 2.</p>

href="#FNanchor_318">[318]</a></span> That this was the real story—a
close parallel of Romulus and Remus—we may see by Herodotus, i, 122.
Some rationalizing Greeks or Persians transformed it into a more
plausible tale,—that the herdsman’s wife who suckled the boy Cyrus
was named Κυνώ (Κυών is a dog, male or female); contending that
this latter was the real basis of fact, and that the intervention
of the bitch was an exaggeration built upon the name of the woman,
in order that the divine protection shown to Cyrus might be still
more manifest,—οἱ δὲ τοκέες παραλαβόντες τὸ οὔνομα τοῦτ (<span
class="gesperrt">ἵνα θειοτέρως δοκέῃ τοῖσι Πέρσῃσι περιεῖναί σφι ὁ

<p>In the first volume of this History, I have noticed various
transformations operated by Palæphatus and others upon the Greek
mythes,—the ram which carried Phryxus and Hellê across the Hellespont
is represented to us as having been in <i>reality</i> a man <i>named Krius</i>,
who aided their flight,—the winged horse which carried Bellerophon
was a ship <i>named</i> Pegasus, etc.</p>

<p>This same operation has here been performed upon the story of the
suckling of Cyrus; for we shall run little risk in affirming that the
miraculous story is the older of the two. The feelings which welcome
a miraculous story are early and primitive; those which break down
the miracle into a common-place fact are of subsequent growth.</p>

Median. See about Nineveh, above,—the Chapter on the Babylonians,

<p>It is remarkable that among the miracles enumerated by Ktêsias,
no mention is made of fire or of the pile of wood kindled: we have
the chains of Crœsus miraculously struck off, in the midst of thunder
and lightning, but no <i>fire</i> mentioned. This is deserving of notice,
as illustrating the fact that Ktêsias derived his information from
<i>Persian</i> narrators, who would not be likely to impute to Cyrus the
use of fire for such a purpose. The Persians worshipped fire as a
god, and considered it impious to burn a dead body (Herodot. iii,
16). Now Herodotus seems to have heard the story, about the burning,
from Lydian informants (λέγεται ὑπὸ Λυδῶν, Herodot. i, 87): whether
the Lydians regarded fire in the same point of view as the Persians,
we do not know; but even if they did, they would not be indisposed
to impute to Cyrus an act of gross impiety, just as the Egyptians
imputed another act equally gross to Kambysês, which Herodotus
himself treats as a falsehood (iii, 16).</p>

<p>The long narrative given by Nikolaus Damaskênus of the treatment
of Crœsus by Cyrus, has been supposed by some to have been borrowed
from the Lydian historian Xanthus, elder contemporary of Herodotus.
But it seems to me a mere compilation, not well put together, from
Xenophon’s Cyropædia, and from the narrative of Herodotus, perhaps
including some particular incidents out of Xanthus (see Nikol. Damas.
Fragm. ed. Orell. pp. 57-70, and the Fragments of Xanthus in Didot’s

<p>O. Müller (Dissertation on the Eumenides of Æschylus, p. 222,
Eng. Transl.) says: “On no occasion does Zeus Soter exert his
influence directly, like Apollo, Minerva, and the Erinnyes; but
whereas Apollo is prophet and exegetes by virtue of wisdom derived
from him, and Minerva is indebted to him for her sway over states
and assemblies,—nay, the very Erinnyes exercise their functions in
his name,—this Zeus stands always in the background, and has in
reality only to settle a conflict existing within himself. For with
Æschylus, as with all men of profound feeling among the Greeks from
the earliest times, Jupiter is the only real god, in the higher sense
of the word. Although he is, in the spirit of ancient theology, a
generated god, arisen out of an imperfect state of things, and not
produced till the third stage of a development of nature,—still he
is, at the time we are speaking of, the spirit that pervades and
governs the universe.”</p>

<p>To the same purpose Klausen expresses himself (Theologumena
Æschyli, pp. 6-69).</p>

<p>It is perfectly true that many passages may be produced from
Greek authors which ascribe to Zeus the supreme power here noted. But
it is equally true that this conception is not uniformly adhered to,
and that sometimes the Fates, or Mœræ are represented as supreme;
occasionally represented as the stronger and Zeus as the weaker
(Promêtheus, 515). The whole tenor of that tragedy, in fact, brings
out the conception of a Zeus τύραννος,—whose power is not supreme,
even for the time; and is not destined to continue permanently, even
at its existing height. The explanations given by Klausen of this
drama appear to me incorrect; nor do I understand how it is to be
reconciled with the above passage quoted from O. Müller.</p>

<p>The two oracles here cited from Herodotus exhibit plainly the
fluctuation of Greek opinion on this subject: in the one, the supreme
determination, and the inexorability which accompanies it, are
ascribed to Zeus,—in the other, to the Mœræ. This double point of
view adapted itself to different occasions, and served as a help for
the interpretation of different events. Zeus was supposed to have
certain sympathies for human beings; misfortunes happened to various
men which he not only did not wish to bring on, but would have
been disposed to avert; here the Mœræ, who had no sympathies, were
introduced as an explanatory cause, tacitly implied as overruling
Zeus. “Cum Furiis Æschylus Parcas tantum non ubique conjungit,”
says Klausen (Theol. Æsch. p. 39); and this entire absence of human
sympathies constitutes the common point of both,—that in which the
Mœræ and the Erinnyes differ from all the other gods,—πέφρικα τὰν
ὠλεσίοικον θεὰν, οὐ θεοῖς ὁμοίαν (Æschyl. Sept. ad Theb. 720):
compare Eumenid. 169, 172, and, indeed, the general strain of that
fearful tragedy.</p>

<p>In Æschylus, as in Herodotus, Apollo is represented as exercising
persuasive powers over the Mœræ (Eumenid. 724),—Μοίρας ἔπεισας
ἀφθίτους θεῖναι βροτούς.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_346"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_346">[346]</a></span> The language of Herodotus
deserves attention. Apollo tells Crœsus: “I applied to the Mœræ to
get the execution of the judgment postponed from your time to that
of your children,—but I could not prevail upon them; but as much as
they would yield <i>of their own accord</i>, I procured for you.” (ὅσον δὲ

<p id="Footnote_348"><span class="label"><a

upon the evidence of Solinus (Polyhistor, i, 112) and Sosikratês (ap.

his Appendix, ch. 17, upon the Lydian kings.</p>

<p>Mr. Clinton and most of the chronologists accept the date
without hesitation, but Volney (Recherches sur l’Histoire Ancienne,
vol. i, pp. 306-308; Chronologie des Rois Lydiens) rejects it
altogether; considering the capture of Sardis to have occurred in
557 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, and the reign of Crœsus to have begun
in 571 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> He treats very contemptuously
the authority of Solinus and Sosikratês, and has an elaborate
argumentation to prove that the date which he adopts is borne out by
Herodotus. This latter does not appear to me at all satisfactory: I
adopt the date of Solinus and Sosikratês, though agreeing with Volney
that such positive authority is not very considerable, because there
is nothing to contradict them, and because the date which they give
seems in consonance with the stream of the history.</p>

<p>Volney’s arguments suppose in the mind of Herodotus a degree
of chronological precision altogether unreasonable, in reference
to events anterior to contemporary records. He, like other
chronologists, exhausts his ingenuity to find a proper point of
historical time for the supposed conversation between Solon and
Crœsus (p.&nbsp;320).</p>

<p>In writing this treatise on the alleged ill-temper of Herodotus,
we see that Plutarch had before him the history of Charôn of
Lampsakus, more ancient by one generation than the historian whom
he was assailing, and also belonging to Asiatic Greece. Of course,
it suited the purpose of his work to produce all the contradictions
to Herodotus which he could find in Charôn: the fact that he has
produced none of any moment, tends to strengthen our faith in
the historian of Halikarnassus, and to show that in the main his

περιβαλέσθαι τὴν πόλιν.</p>

<p>I do not understand why the commentators debate what or who is
meant by τὸν Μῆδον: it plainly means the Median or Persian power
generally: but the chronological difficulty is a real one, if we are
to suppose that there was time between the first alarm conceived of
the Median power of the Ionians, and the siege of Phôkæa by Harpagus,
to inform Arganthônius of the circumstances, and to procure from him
this large aid as well as to build the fortifications. The Ionic
Greeks neither actually did conceive, nor had reason to conceive,
any alarm respecting Persian power, until the arrival of Cyrus
before Sardis; and within a month from that time Sardis was in his
possession. If we are to suppose communication with Arganthônius,
grounded upon this circumstance, at the distance of Tartêssus, and
under the circumstances of ancient navigation, we must necessarily
imagine, also, that the attack made by Harpagus upon Phôkæa—which
city he assailed before any of the rest—was postponed for at least
two or three years. Such postponement is not wholly impossible, yet
it is not in the spirit of the Herodotean narrative, nor do I think
it likely. It is much more probable that the informants of Herodotus
made a slip in chronology, and ascribed the donations of Arganthônius
to a motive which did not really dictate them.</p>

<p>As to the fortifications (which Phôkæa and the other Ionic
cities are reported to have erected after the conquest of Sardis by
the Persians), the case may stand thus. While these cities were all
independent, before they were first conquered by Crœsus, they must
undoubtedly have had fortifications. When Crœsus conquered them, he
directed the demolition of the fortifications; but demolition does
not necessarily mean pulling down the entire walls: when one or a few
breaches are made, the city is laid open, and the purpose of Crœsus
would thus be answered. Such may well have been the state of the
Ionian cities at the time when they first thought it necessary to
provide defences against the Persians at Sardis: they repaired and
perfected the breached fortifications.</p>

<p>The conjecture of Larcher (see the Notes both of Larcher and
Wesseling),—τὸν Λυδὸν instead of τὸν Μῆδον,—is not an unreasonable
one, if it had any authority: the donation of Arganthônius would then
be transferred to the period anterior to the Lydian conquest: it
would get rid of the chronological difficulty above adverted to, but
it would introduce some new awkwardness into the narrative.</p>

Thousand Greeks were involved, after the battle of Kunaxa, and the
insurmountable obstacles which impeded their march, assuming any
resisting force whatever, see Xenoph. Anab. ii, 1, 11; ii, 2, 3;
ii, 3, 10; ii, 4, 12-13. These obstacles, doubtless, served as a
protection to them against attack, not less than as an impediment to
their advance; and the well-supplied villages enabled them to obtain
plenty of provisions: hence the anxiety of the Great King to help
them across the Tigris out of Babylonia. But it is not easy to see
how, in the face of such difficulties, any invading army could reach
Babylon.</p>

<p>Ritter represents the wall of Media as having reached across from
the Euphratês to the Tigris at the point where they come nearest
together, about two hundred stadia or twenty-five miles across. But
it is nowhere stated, so far as I can find, that this wall reached
to the Euphratês,—still less that its length was two hundred stadia,
for the passages of Strabo cited by Ritter do not prove either point
(ii, 80; xi, 529). And Xenophon (ii, 4, 12) gives the length of the
wall as I have stated it in the text, = 20 parasangs = 600 stadia =
75 miles.</p>

<p>The passage of the Anabasis (i, 7, 15) seems to connect the
Median wall with the canals, and not with the river Euphratês. The
narrative of Herodotus, as I have remarked in a former chapter, leads
us to suppose that he descended that river to Babylon; and if we
suppose that the wall did not reach the Euphratês, this would afford
some reason why he makes no mention of it. See Ritter, West Asien, b.
iii, Abtheilung iii, Abschn. i, sect. 29, pp. 19-22.</p>

portion of the story, if we may judge from the expression of
Herodotus, seems to excite more doubt in his mind than all the rest,
for he thinks it necessary to add, “as the residents at Babylon say,”
ὡς λέγεται ὑπὸ τῶν ταύτῃ οἰκημένων. Yet if we assume the size of the
place to be what he has affirmed, there seems nothing remarkable in
the fact that the people in the centre did not at once hear of the
capture; for the first business of the assailants would be to possess
themselves of the walls and gates. It is a lively illustration of
prodigious magnitude, and as such it is given by Aristotle (Polit.
iii, 1, 12); who, however, exaggerates it by giving as a report that
the inhabitants in the centre did not hear of the capture until the
third day. No such exaggeration as this appears in Herodotus.</p>

<p>Xenophon, in the Cyropædia (vii, 5, 7-18), following the story
that Cyrus drained off the Euphratês, represents it as effected in a
manner differing from Herodotus. According to him, Cyrus dug two vast
and deep ditches, one on each side round the town, from the river
above the town to the river below it: watching the opportunity of a
festival day in Babylon, he let the water into both of these side
ditches, which fell into the main stream again below the town: hence
the main stream in its passage through the town became nearly dry.
The narrative of Xenophon, however, betrays itself, as not having
been written from information received on the spot, like that of
Herodotus; for he talks of αἱ ἄκραι of Babylon, just as he speaks
of the ἄκραι of the hill-towns of Karia (compare Cyropædia, vii,
4, 1, 7, with vii, 5, 34). There were no ἄκραι on the dead flat of
Babylon.</p>

<p>This passage—asserting that the Medes, some time after the
deposition of Astyagês and the acquisition of Persian supremacy by
Cyrus, repented of having suffered their discontent against Astyagês
to place this supremacy in the hands of the Persians, revolted from
Darius, and were reconquered after a contest—appears to me to have
been misunderstood by chronologists. Dodwell, Larcher, and Mr. Fynes
Clinton (indeed, most, if not all, of the chronologists) explain
it as alluding to a revolt of the Medes against the Persian king
Darius Nothus, mentioned in the Hellenica of Xenophon (i, 2, 12),
and belonging to the year 408 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> See Larcher ad
Herodot. i, 130, and his Vie d’Hérodote, prefixed to his translation
(p. lxxxix); also Mr. Clinton, Fasti Hellenici, ad ann. 408 and 455,
and his Appendix, c, 18, p. 316.</p>

<p>The revolt of the Medes alluded to by Herodotus is, in my
judgment, completely distinct from the revolt mentioned by Xenophon:
to identify the two, as these eminent chronologists do, is an
hypothesis not only having nothing to recommend it, but open to grave
objection. The revolt mentioned by Herodotus was against Darius son
of Hystaspês, not against Darius Nothus; and I have set forth with
peculiar care the circumstances connected with the conspiracy and
accession of the former, for the purpose of showing that they all
decidedly imply that conflict between Median and Persian supremacy,
which Herodotus directly announces in the passage now before us.</p>

<p>1. When Herodotus speaks of Darius, without any adjective
designation, why should we imagine that he means any other than
Darius the son of Hystaspês, on whom he dwells so copiously in his
narrative? Once only in the course of his history (ix, 108) another
Darius (the young prince, son of Xerxês the First) is mentioned; but
with this exception, Darius son of Hystaspês is uniformly, throughout
the work, spoken of under his simple name: Darius Nothus is never
alluded to at all.</p>

<p>2. The deposition of Astyagês took place in 559 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>; the beginning of the reign of Darius occurred in 520
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>; now repentance on the part of the Medes,
for what they had done at the former of those two epochs, might
naturally prompt them to try to repair it in the latter. But between
the deposition of Astyagês in 559 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, and the
revolt mentioned by Xenophon against Darius Nothus in 408 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, the interval is more than one hundred and fifty years.
To ascribe a revolt which took place in 408 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,
to repentance for something which had occurred one hundred and
fifty years before, is unnatural and far-fetched, if not positively
inadmissible.</p>

<p>The preceding arguments go to show that the natural construction
of the passage in Herodotus points to Darius son of Hystaspês, and
not to Darius Nothus; but this is not all. There are yet stronger
reasons why the reference to Darius Nothus should be discarded.</p>

<p>The supposed mention, in Herodotus, of a fact so late as 408
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, perplexes the whole chronology of his life and
authorship. According to the usual statement of his biography, which
every one admits, and which there is no reason to call in question,
he was born in 484 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> Here, then, is an event
alluded to in his history, which occurred when the historian was
seventy-six years old, and the allusion to which he must be presumed
to have written when about eighty years old, if not more; for his
mention of the fact by no means implies that it was particularly
recent. Those who adopt this view, do not imagine that he wrote his
whole history at that age; but they maintain that he made later
additions, of which they contend that this is one. I do not say that
this is impossible: we know that Isokratês composed his Panathenaic
oration at the age of ninety-four; but it must be admitted to be
highly improbable,—a supposition which ought not to be advanced
without some cogent proof to support it. But here no proof whatever
is produced. Herodotus mentions a revolt of the Medes against
Darius,—Xenophon also mentions a revolt of the Medes against Darius;
hence, chronologists have taken it as a matter of course, that both
authors must allude to the same event; though the supposition is
unnatural as regards the text, and still more unnatural as regards
the biography, of Herodotus.</p>

<p>In respect to that biography, Mr. Clinton appears to me to have
adopted another erroneous opinion; in which, however, both Larcher
and Wesseling are against him, though Dahlmann and Heyse agree with
him. He maintains that the passage in Herodotus (iii, 15), wherein
it is stated that Pausiris succeeded his father Amyrtæus by consent
of the Persians in the government of Egypt, is to be referred to a
fact which happened subsequent to the year 414 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,
or the tenth year of Darius Nothus; since it was in that year that
Amyrtæus acquired the government of Egypt. But this opinion rests
altogether upon the assumption that a certain Amyrtæus, whose name
and date occur in Manetho (see Eusebius, Chronicon), is the same
person as the Amyrtæus mentioned in Herodotus; which identity
is not only not proved, but is extremely improbable, since Mr.
Clinton himself admits (F. H. Appendix, p. 317), while maintaining
the identity: “He (Amyrtæus) had conducted a war against the
Persian government <i>more than fifty years before</i>.” This, though
not impossible, is surely very improbable; it is at least equally
probable that the Amyrtæus of Manetho was a different person from
(perhaps even the <i>grandson</i> of) that Amyrtæus in Herodotus, who had
carried on war against the Persians more than fifty wars before; it
appears to me, indeed, that this is the more reasonable hypothesis of
the two.</p>

<p>I have permitted myself to prolong this note to an unusual
length, because the supposed mention of such recent events in the
history of Herodotus, as those in the reign of Darius Nothus, has
introduced very gratuitous assumptions as to the time and manner
in which that history was composed. It cannot be shown that there
is a single event of precise and ascertained date, alluded to in
his history, later than the capture of the Lacedæmonian heralds in
the year 430 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> (Herodot. vii, 137: see Larcher,
Vie d’Hérodote, p. lxxxix); and this renders the composition of his
history as an entire work much more smooth and intelligible.</p>

<p>It may be worth while to add, that whoever reads attentively
Herodotus, vi, 98,—and reflects at the same time that the destruction
of the Athenian armament at Syracuse (the greatest of all Hellenic
disasters, hardly inferior, for its time, to the Russian campaign
of Napoleon, and especially impressive to one living at Thurii,
as may be seen by the life of Lysias, Plutarch, Vit. x, Oratt. p.
835) happened during the reign of Darius Nothus in 413 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,—will not readily admit the hypothesis of additions made
to the history during the reign of the latter, or so late as 408
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> Herodotus would hardly have dwelt so expressly
and emphatically upon mischief done by Greeks to each other in the
reigns of Darius son of Hystaspês, Xerxês, and Artaxerxês, if he
had lived to witness the greater mischiefs so inflicted during the
reign of Darius Nothus, and had kept his history before him for the
purpose of inserting new events. The destruction of the Athenians
before Syracuse would have been a thousand times more striking to his
imagination than the revolt of the Medes against Darius Nothus, and
would have impelled him with much greater force to alter or enlarge
the chapter vi, 98.</p>

<p>The sentiment too which Herodotus places in the mouth of
Demaratus respecting the Spartans (vii, 104) appears to have been
written <i>before</i> the capture of the Spartans in Sphakteria, in 425
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, rather than <i>after</i> it: compare Thucyd. iv, 40.
</p>

<p>Dahlmann (Forschungen auf dem Gebiete der Geschichte, vol. ii,
pp. 41-47) and Heyse (Quæstiones Herodoteæ, pp. 74-77, Berlin,
1827) both profess to point out six passages in Herodotus which
mark events of later date than 430 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> But none
of the chronological indications which they adduce appear to me
trustworthy.</p>

and recapture of Babylon to have taken place, not under Darius, but
under his son and successor Xerxês. He says that the Babylonians,
revolting, slew their satrap Zopyrus; that they were besieged by
Xerxês, and that Megabyzus son of Zopyrus caused the city to be taken
by practising that very stratagem which Herodotus ascribes to Zopyrus
himself (Persica, c. 20-22).</p>

<p>This seems inconsistent with the fact, that Megabyzus was general
of the Persian army in Egypt in the war with the Athenians, about
460 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> (Diodor. Sic. xi, 75-77): he would hardly
have been sent on active service had he been so fearfully mutilated;

<p>To crucify subdued revolters by thousands is, fortunately, so
little in harmony with modern European manners, that it may not be
amiss to strengthen the confidence of the reader in the accuracy of
Herodotus, by producing an analogous narrative of incidents far more
recent. Voltaire gives, from the MS. of General Lefort, one of the
principal and confidential officers of Peter the Great, the following
account of the suppression of the revolted Strelitzes at Moscow, in
1698: these Strelitzes were the old native militia, or Janissaries,
of the Russian Czars, opposed to all the reforms of Peter.</p>

<p>“Pour étouffer ces troubles, le czar part secrètement de Vienne,
arrive enfin à Moscou, et surprend tout le monde par sa présence:
il récompense les troupes qui ont vaincu les Strélitz: les prisons
étaient pleines de ces malheureux. Si leur crime était grand, le
châtiment le fut aussi. Leurs chefs, plusieurs officiers, et quelques
prêtres, furent condamnés à la mort: quelques-uns furent roués, deux
femmes enterrées vives. On pendit autour des murailles de la ville
et on fit périr dans d’autres supplices deux mille Strélitz; leurs
corps restèrent deux jours exposés sur les grands chemins, et surtout
autour du monastère où résidaient les princesses Sophie et Eudoxe.
On érigea des colonnes de pierre où le crime et le châtiment furent
gravés. Un très-grand nombre qui avaient leurs femmes et leurs enfans
furent dispersés avec leurs familles dans la Sibérie, dans le royaume
d’Astrakhan, dans le pays d’Azof: par là du moins leur punition fut
utile à l’état: ils servirent à défricher des terres qui manquaient
d’habitans et de culture.” (Voltaire, Histoire de Russie, part i, ch.

href="#FNanchor_424">[424]</a></span> Herodot. iii, 95. The text of
Herodotus contains an erroneous summing up of items, which critics
have no means of correcting with certainty. Nor is it possible
to trust the huge sum which he alleges to have been levied from
the Indians, though all the other items, included in the nineteen
silver-paying divisions, seem within the probable truth; and indeed
both Rennell and Robertson think the total too small: the charges on
some of the satrapies are decidedly smaller than the reality.</p>

<p>The vast sum of fifty thousand talents is said to have been
found by Alexander the Great, laid up by successive kings at Susa
alone, besides the treasures at Persepolis, Pasargadæ, and elsewhere
(Arrian, iii, 16, 12; Plutarch, Alexand. 37). Presuming these talents
to be Babylonian or Æginæan talents (in the proportion 5&nbsp;:&nbsp;3 to Attic
talents), fifty thousand talents would be equal to nineteen million
pounds sterling; if they were Attic talents, it would be equal to
eleven million six hundred thousand pounds sterling. The statements
of Diodorus give even much larger sums (xvii, 66-71: compare Curtius,
v, 2, 8; v, 6, 9; Strabo, xv, p. 730). It is plain that the numerical
affirmations were different in different authors, and one cannot
pretend to pronounce on the trustworthiness of such large figures
without knowing more of the original returns on which they were
founded. That there were prodigious sums of gold and silver, is quite
unquestionable. Respecting the statement of the Persian revenue given
by Herodotus, see Boeckh, Metrologie, ch. v, 1-2.</p>

<p>Amedée Jaubert, in 1806, estimated the population of the modern
Persian empire at about seven million souls; of which about six
million were settled population, the rest nomadic: he also estimated
the Schah’s revenue at about two million nine hundred thousand
tomans, or one million five hundred thousand pounds sterling. Others
calculated the population higher, at nearer twelve million souls.
Kinneir gives the revenue at something more than three million pounds
sterling: he thinks that the whole territory between the Euphratês
and the Indus does not contain above eighteen millions of souls
(Geogr. Memoir of Persia, pp. 44-47: compare Ritter, West Asien,
Abtheil. ii, Abschn. iv, pp. 879-889).</p>

<p>The modern Persian empire contains not so much as the eastern
half of the ancient, which covered all Asiatic Turkey and Egypt
besides.</p>

<p>It certainly is singular that neither Nearchus, nor Ptolemy,
nor Aristobulus, nor Arrian, take any notice of this remarkable
voyage distinctly asserted by Herodotus to have been accomplished.
Such silence, however, affords no sufficient reason for calling the
narrative in question. The attention of the Persian kings, successors
to Darius, came to be far more occupied with the western than with
the eastern portions of their empire.</p>

<p>The gold Daric, of the weight of two Attic drachmæ; (Stater
Daricus), equivalent to twenty Attic silver drachmæ (Xenoph. Anab. i,
7, 18), would be about 16<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> English. But it seems doubtful
whether that ratio between gold and silver (10&nbsp;:&nbsp;1) can be reckoned
upon as the ordinary ratio in the fifth and fourth centuries
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> Mr. Hussey calculates the golden Daric as equal
to £1, 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> English (Hussey, Essay on the Ancient Weights and
Money, Oxford, 1836, ch. iv, s. 8, p. 68; ch. vii, s. 3, p. 103).</p>

<p>I cannot think, with Mr. Hussey, that there is any reason for
believing either the name or the coin <i>Daric</i> to be older than Darius
son of Hystaspês. Compare Boeckh, Metrologie, ix, 5, p. 129.</p>

<p>Particular statements respecting the value of gold and silver, as
exchanged one against the other, are to be received with some reserve
as the basis of any general estimate, since we have not the means of
comparing a great many such statements together. For the process of
coinage was imperfectly performed, and the different pieces, both of
gold and silver, in circulation, differed materially in weight one
with the other. Herodotus gives the ratio of gold to silver as
13&nbsp;:&nbsp;1.</p>

description refers to surgical rather than to medical practice.</p>

<p>That curious assemblage of the cases of particular patients with
remarks, known in the works of Hippokratês, under the title Ἐπιδήμιαι
(Notes of visits to different cities), is very illustrative of what
Herodotus here mentions about Dêmokêdês. Consult, also, the valuable
Prolegomena of M. Littré, in his edition of Hippokratês now in course
of publication, as to the character, means of action, and itinerant
habits of the Grecian ἰατροί: see particularly the preface to vol.
v, p. 12, where he enumerates the various places visited and noted
by Hippokratês. The greater number of the Hippokratic observations
refer to various parts of Thrace, Macedonia, and Thessaly; but there
are some, also, which refer to patients in the islands of Syros and
Delos, at Athens, Salamis, Elis, Corinth, and Œniadæ in Akarnania.
“On voit par là combien étoit juste le nom de Periodeutes ou
voyageurs donnés à ces anciens médecins.”</p>

<p>Again, M. Littré, in the same preface, p. 25, illustrates the
proceedings and residence of the ancient ἰατρός: “On se tromperoit
si on se représentoit la demeure d’un médecin d’alors comme celle
d’un médecin d’aujourd’hui. La maison du médecin de l’antiquité, du
moins au temps d’Hippocrate et aux époques voisines, renfermoit un
local destiné à la pratique d’un grand nombre d’opérations, contenant
les machines et les instrumens nécessaires, et de plus étant aussi
une boutique de pharmacie. Ce local se nommait ἰατρεῖον.” See Plato,
Legg. i, p. 646, iv, p. 720. Timæus accused Aristotle of having begun
as a surgeon, practising to great profit in surgery, or ἰατρεῖον, and
having quitted this occupation late in life, to devote himself to
the study of science,—σοφιστὴν ὀψιμαθῆ καὶ μισητὸν ὑπάρχοντα, καὶ τὸ
πολυτίμητον ἰατρεῖον ἀρτίως ἀποκεκλεικότα (Polyb. xii, 9).</p>

<p>See, also, the Remarques Retrospectives attached by M. Littré
to volume iv, of the same work (pp. 654-658), where he dwells upon
the intimate union of surgical and medical practice in antiquity. At
the same time, it must be remarked that a passage in the remarkable
medical oath, published in the collection of Hippokratic treatises,
recognizes in the plainest manner the distinction between the
physician and the operator,—the former binds himself by this oath
not to perform the operation “even of lithotomy, but to leave it to
the operators, or workmen:” Οὐ τεμέω δὲ οὐδὲ μὴν λιθιῶντας, ἐκχωρήσω
δὲ ἐργάστῃσιν ἀνδράσι πρήξιος τῆσδε (Œuvres d’Hippocrate, vol. iv,
p. 630, ed. Littré). M. Littré (p. 617) contests this explanation,
remarking that the various Hippokratic treatises represent the ἰατρός
as performing all sorts of operations, even such as require violent
and mechanical dealing. But the words of the oath are so explicit,
that it seems more reasonable to assign to the oath itself a later
date than the treatises, when the habits of practitioners may have
changed.</p>

<p id="Footnote_480"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_480">[480]</a></span> Herodot. iv, 1, 83. There is
nothing to mark the precise year of the Scythian expedition; but as
the accession of Darius is fixed to 521 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, and
as the expedition is connected with the early part of his reign, we
may conceive him to have entered upon it as soon as his hands were
free; that is, as soon as he had put down the revolted satraps and
provinces, Orœtês, the Medes, Babylonians, etc. Five years seems a
reasonable time to allow for these necessities of the empire, which
would bring the Scythian expedition to 516-515 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>
There is reason for supposing it to have been before 514 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, for in that year Hipparchus was slain at Athens, and
Hippias the surviving brother, looking out for securities and
alliances abroad, gave his daughter in marriage to Æantidês son
of Hippoklus, despot of Lampsakus, “perceiving that Hippoklus and
his son had great influence with Darius,” (Thucyd. vi, 59.) Now
Hippoklus could not well have acquired this influence <i>before</i> the
Scythian expedition; for Darius came down then for the first time
to the western sea; Hippoklus served upon that expedition (Herodot.
iv, 138), and it was probably then that his favor was acquired, and
farther confirmed during the time that Darius stayed at Sardis after
his return from Scythia.</p>

<p>Professor Schultz (Beiträge zu genaueren Zeitbestimmungen der
Hellen. Geschicht. von der 63<sup>n</sup> bis zur 72<sup>n</sup>
Olympiade, p. 168, in the Kieler Philolog. Studien) places the
expedition in 513 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>; but I think a year or two
earlier is more probable. Larcher, Wesseling, and Bähr (ad Herodot.
iv, 145) place it in 508 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, which is later
than the truth; indeed, Larcher himself places the reduction of
Lemnos and Imbros by Otanês in 511 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, though
that event decidedly came after the Scythian expedition (Herodot.
v, 27; Larcher, Table Chronologique, Trad. d’Hérodot. t. vii, pp.
633-635).</p>

<p>Æschylus (Persæ. 864), who presents the deceased Darius as a
glorious contrast with the living Xerxês, talks of the splendid
conquests which he made by means of others,—“without crossing the
Halys himself, nor leaving his home.” We are led to suppose, by
the language which Æschylus puts into the mouth of the Eidôlon of
Darius (v, 720-745), that he had forgotten, or had never heard of,
the bridge thrown across the Bosphorus by order of Darius; for the
latter is made to condemn severely the impious insolence of Xerxês in
bridging over the Hellespont.</p>

the Danube and the Tyras (Dniester) is justly pronounced by Niebuhr
(Kleine Schriften, p. 372) to be a mere supposition suggested by
the probabilities of the case, because it could not be understood
how his large army should cross even the Dniester: it is not to be
treated as an affirmation resting upon any authority. “As Herodotus
tells us what is impossible (adds Niebuhr), we know nothing at all
historically respecting the expedition.”</p>

<p>So again the conjecture of Palmerius (Exercitationes ad Auctores
Græcos, p. 21) carries on the march somewhat farther than the
Dniester,—to the Hypanis, or <i>perhaps</i> to the Borysthenês. Rennell,
Klaproth, and Reichard, are not afraid to extend the march on to the
Wolga. Dr. Thirlwall stops within the Tanais, admitting, however,
that no correct historical account can be given of it. Eichwald
supposes a long march up the Dniester into Volhynia and Lithuania.

Miltiadês could have remained in the Chersonese undisturbed, during
the interval between the Scythian expedition of Darius and the Ionic
revolt,—when the Persians were complete masters of those regions,
and when Otanês was punishing other towns in the neighborhood for
evasion of service under Darius, after he had declared so pointedly
against the Persians on a matter of life and death to the king and
army,—appears to me, as it does to Dr. Thirlwall (History of Gr. vol.
ii, App. ii, p. 486, ch. xiv, pp. 226-249), eminently improbable. So
forcibly does Dr. Thirlwall feel the difficulty, that he suspects the
reported conduct and exhortations of Miltiadês at the bridge over the
Danube to have been a falsehood, fabricated by Miltiadês himself,
twenty years afterwards, for the purpose of acquiring popularity at
Athens during the time immediately preceding the battle of Marathon.
</p>

<p>I cannot think this hypothesis admissible. It directly
contradicts Herodotus on a matter of fact very conspicuous, and
upon which good means of information seem to have been within his
reach. I have already observed that the historian Hekatæus must have
possessed personal knowledge of all the relations between the Ionians
and Darius, and that he very probably may have been even present at
the bridge: all the information given by Hekatæus upon these points
would be open to the inquiries of Herodotus. The unbounded gratitude
of Darius towards Histiæus shows that some one or more of the Ionic
despots present at the bridge must have powerfully enforced the
expediency of breaking it down. That the name of the despot who
stood forward as prime mover of this resolution should have been
forgotten and not mentioned at the time, is highly improbable; yet
such must have been the case if a fabrication by Miltiadês twenty
years afterwards could successfully fill up the blank with his own
name. The two most prominent matters talked of, after the retreat
of Darius, in reference to the bridge, would probably be the name
of the leader who urged its destruction, and the name of Histiæus,
who preserved it. Indeed, the mere fact of the mischievous influence
exercised by the latter afterwards would be pretty sure to keep these
points of the case in full view.</p>

<p>There are means of escaping from the difficulty of the case,
I think, without contradicting Herodotus on any matter of fact
important and conspicuous, or indeed on any matter of fact whatever.
We see by vi, 40, that Miltiadês <i>did quit the Chersonese</i> between
the close of the Scythian expedition of Darius and the Ionic revolt;
Herodotus, indeed, tells us that he quitted it in consequence of an
incursion of the Scythians: but without denying the fact of such
an incursion, we may reasonably suppose the historian to have been
mistaken in assigning it as the cause of the flight of Miltiadês.
The latter was prevented from living in the Chersonese continuously,
during the interval between the Persian invasion of Scythia and the
Ionic revolt, by fear of Persian enmity. It is not necessary for us
to believe that he was never there at all, but his residence there
must have been interrupted and insecure. The chronological data in
Herodot. vi, 40, are exceedingly obscure and perplexing; but it seems
to me that the supposition which I suggest introduces a plausible
coherence into the series of historical facts, with the slightest
possible contradiction to our capital witness.</p>

<p>The only achievement of Miltiadês, between the affair on the
Danube and his return to Athens shortly before the battle of
Marathon, is the conquest of Lemnos; and <i>that</i> must have taken
place evidently while the Persians were occupied by the Ionic
revolt, (between 502-494 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>) There is nothing in
his recorded deeds inconsistent with the belief, therefore, that
between 515-502 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> he may not have resided in
the Chersonese at all, or at least not for very long together: and
the statement of Cornelius Nepos, that he quitted it immediately
after the return from Scythia, from fear of the Persians, may be
substantially true. Dr. Thirlwall observes (p. 487)—“As little would
it appear that when the Scythians invaded the Chersonese, Miltiadês
was conscious of having endeavored to render them an important
service. He flies before them, though he had been so secure while the
Persian arms were in his neighborhood.” He has here put his finger
on what I believe to be the error of Herodotus,—the supposition that
Miltiadês fled from the Chersonese to avoid the Scythians, whereas he
really left it to avoid the Persians.</p>

<p>The story of Strabo (xiii, p. 591), that Darius caused the Greek
cities on the Asiatic side of the Hellespont to be burnt down,
in order to hinder them from affording means of transport to the
Scythians into Asia, seems to me highly improbable. These towns
appear in their ordinary condition, Abydus among them, at the time of
the Ionic revolt a few years afterwards (Herodot. v, 117).</p>

πολλὸν χρόνον, ἄνεως κακῶν ἦν—or ἄνεσις κακῶν—if the conjecture of
some critics be adopted. Mr. Clinton, with Larcher and others (see
Fasti Hellen. App. 18, p. 314), construe this passage as if the comma
were to be placed after μετὰ δὲ, so that the historian would be made
to affirm that the period of repose lasted only a short time. It
appears to me that the comma ought rather to be placed after χρόνον,
and that the “short time” refers to those evils which the historian
had been describing before. There must have been an interval of eight
years at least, if not of ten years, between the events which the
historian had been describing—the evils inflicted by the attacks of
Otanês—and the breaking out of the Ionic revolt; which latter event
no one places earlier than 504 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, though some
prefer 502 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, others even 500 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>

of Otanês and the Ionic revolt would be contracted into one or two
years. But I have already observed that I cannot think 508 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> a correct date for the Scythian expedition: it seems to me
to belong to about 515 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> Nor do I know what reason
there is for determining the date as Wesseling does, except this very
phrase οὐ πολλὸν χρόνον, which is on every supposition exceedingly
vague, and which he appears to me not to have construed in the best

described particular countries. There is no proof of this, nor can I
think it probable: the passage of Apollonius Rhodius (iv, 279) with
the Scholia to it, which is cited as evidence, appears to me unworthy
of attention.</p>

<p>Among the Roman Agrimensores, it was the ancient practice to
engrave their plans, of land surveyed, upon tablets of brass, which
were deposited in the public archives, and of which copies were made
for private use, though the original was referred to in case of legal
dispute (Siculus Flaccus ap. Rei Agrariæ Scriptores, p. 16, ed. Goes:
compare Giraud, Recherches sur le Droit de Propriété, p. 116, Aix,
1838).</p>

not uninteresting to compare, with this reconquest of Cyprus by the
Persians, the conquest of the same island by the Turks in 1570,
when they expelled from it the Venetians. See the narrative of
that conquest (effected in the reign of Selim the Second by the
Seraskier Mustapha-Pasha), in Von Hammer, Geschichte des Osmannischen
Reichs, book xxxvi, vol. iii, pp. 578-589. Of the two principal
towns, Nikosia in the centre of the island, and Famagusta on the
north-eastern coast, the first, after a long siege, was taken by
storm, and the inhabitants of every sex and age either put to death
or carried into slavery; while the second, after a most gallant
defence, was allowed to capitulate. But the terms of the capitulation
were violated in the most flagitious manner by the Seraskier, who
treated the brave Venetian governor, Bragadino, with frightful
cruelty, cutting off his nose and ears, exposing him to all sorts of
insults, and ultimately causing him to be flayed alive. The skin of
this unfortunate general was conveyed to Constantinople as a trophy,
but in after-times found its way to Venice.</p>

<p>We read of nothing like this treatment of Bragadino in the
Persian reconquest of Cyprus, though it was a subjugation after
revolt; indeed, nothing like it in all Persian warfare.</p>

<p>Von Hammer gives a short sketch (not always very accurate as
to ancient times) of the condition of Cyprus under its successive
masters,—Persians, Græco-Egyptians, Romans, Arabians, the dynasty of
Lusignan, Venetians, and Turks,—the last seems decidedly the worst of
all.</p>

<p>In reference to the above-mentioned piece of cruelty, I may
mention that the Persian king Kambysês caused one of the royal judges
(according to Herodotus v, 25), who had taken a bribe to render an
iniquitous judgment, to be flayed alive, and his skin to be stretched
upon the seat on which his son was placed to succeed him; as a lesson
of justice to the latter. A similar story is told respecting the
Persian king Artaxerxês Mnêmon; and what is still more remarkable,
the same story is also recounted in the Turkish history, as an act of
Mohammed the Second (Von Hammer, Geschichte des Osmannisch. Reichs,
book xvii, vol. ii, p. 209; Diodorus, xv, 10). Ammianus Marcellinus
(xxiii, 6) had good reason to treat the reality of the fact as
problematical.</p>

ἄκρης, ἐν τῷ ἑκτῷ ἔτεϊ ἀπὸ τῆς ἀποστάσιος τῆς Ἀρισταγόρεω. This is
almost the only distinct chronological statement which we find in
Herodotus respecting the Ionic revolt. The other evidences of time
in his chapters are more or less equivocal: nor is there sufficient
testimony before us to enable us to arrange the events, between the
commencement of the Ionic revolt, and the battle of Marathon, into
the precise years to which they belong. The battle of Marathon stands
fixed for August or September, 490 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>: the siege
of Milêtus may probably have been finished in 496-495 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, and the Ionic revolt may have begun in 502-501 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> Such are the dates which, on the whole, appear to me most
probable, though I am far from considering them as certain.</p>

<p>Chronological critics differ considerably in their arrangement
of the events here alluded to among particular years. See Appendix,
No. 5, p. 244, in Mr. Clinton’s Fasti Hellenici; Professor Schultz,
Beyträge zu genaueren Zeitbestimmungen von der 63<sup>n</sup> zur
72<sup>n</sup> Olympiade, pp. 177-183, in the Kieler Philologische
Studien; and Weissenborn, Beyträge zur genaueren Erforschung der
alten Griechischen Geschichte, Jena, 1844, p. 87, <i>seqq.</i>: not to
mention Reiz and Larcher. Mr. Clinton reckons only ten years from
the beginning of the Ionic revolt to the battle of Marathon; which
appears to me too short; though, on the other hand, the fourteen
years reckoned by Larcher—much more the sixteen years reckoned by
Reiz—are too long. Mr. Clinton compresses inconveniently the latter
portion of the interval,—that portion which elapsed between the
siege of Milêtus and the battle of Marathon. And the very improbable
supposition to which he is obliged to resort,—of a confusion in the
language of Herodotus between Attic and Olympic years,—indicates that
he is pressing the text of the historian too closely, when he states,
“that Herodotus specifies a term of three years between the capture
of Milêtus, and the expedition of Datis:” see F. H. ad ann. 499. He
places the capture of Milêtus in 494 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>; which I
am inclined to believe a year later—if not two years later—than the
reality. Indeed, as Mr. Clinton places the expedition of Aristagoras
against Naxos (which was <i>immediately before</i> the breaking out of the
revolt, since Aristagoras seized the Ionic despots while that fleet
yet remained congregated immediately at the close of the expedition)
in 501 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, and as Herodotus expressly says that
Milêtus was taken in the sixth year after the revolt, it would follow
that this capture ought to belong to 495, and not to 494 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> I incline to place it either in 496, or in 495; and the
Naxian expedition in 502 or 501, leaning towards the earlier of
the two dates: Schultz agrees with Larcher in placing the Naxian
expedition in 504 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, yet he assigns the capture of
Milêtus to 496 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>,—whereas, Herodotus states that
the last of these two events was in the sixth year after the revolt,
which revolt immediately succeeded on the first of the two, within
the same summer. Weissenborn places the capture of Milêtus in 496
<small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>, and the expedition to Naxos in 499,—suspecting
that the text in Herodotus—ἑκτῷ ἔτεϊ—is incorrect, and that it
ought to be τετάρτῳ ἔτεϊ, the fourth year (p. 125: compare the
chronological table in his work, p. 222). He attempts to show that
the particular incidents composing the Ionic revolt, as Herodotus
recounts it, cannot be made to occupy more than four years; but his
reasoning is, in my judgment, unsatisfactory, and the conjecture
inadmissible. The distinct affirmation of the historian, as to the
entire interval between the two events, is of much more evidentiary
value than our conjectural summing up of the details.</p>

<p>It is vain, I think, to try to arrange these details according to
precise years: this can only be done very loosely.</p>

a democracy,—ἐνθαῦτα μέγιστον θώϋμα ἐρέω τοῖσι μὴ ἀποδεκομένοισι τῶν
Ἑλλήνων, Περσέων τοῖσι ἕπτα Ὀτάνεα γνώμην ἀποδέξασθαι, ὡς χρέων εἴη

ὁ Μαρδόνιος, δημοκρατίας κατίστα ἐς τὰς πόλιας. Such passages as this
let us into the controversies of the time, and prove that Herodotus
found many objectors to his story about the discussion on theories of
government among the seven Persian conspirators (iii, 80-82).</p>

<a href="#Chap_31">chapter xxxi</a>. The legendary story there given
as the provocation of Ægina to the war is evidently not to be treated
as a real and historical cause of war: a state of quarrel causes all
such stories to be raked up, and some probably to be invented. It is
like the old alleged quarrel between the Athenians and the Pelasgi of
Lemnos (vi, 137-140).</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_593"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_593">[593]</a></span> It is to this treatment of
the herald that the story in Plutarch’s Life of Themistoklês must
allude, if that story indeed be true; for the Persian king was not
likely to send a second herald, after such treatment of the first.
An interpreter accompanied the herald, speaking Greek as well as his
own native language. Themistoklês proposed and carried a vote that
he should be put to death, for having employed the Greek language as
medium for barbaric dictation (Plutarch, Themist. c. 6). We should be
glad to know from whom Plutarch copied this story.</p>

<p>Pausanias states that it was Miltiadês who proposed the putting
to death of the heralds at Athens (iii, 12, 6); and that the divine
judgment fell upon his family in consequence of it. From whom
Pausanias copied this statement I do not know: certainly not from
Herodotus, who does not mention Miltiadês in the case, and expressly
says that he does not know in what manner the divine judgment
overtook the Athenians for the crime, “except (says he) that their
city and country was afterwards laid waste by Xerxês; but I do not
think that this happened on account of the outrage on the heralds.”
(Herodot. vii, 133.)</p>

<p>The belief that there must have been a divine judgment of
some sort or other, presented a strong stimulus to invent or
twist some historical fact to correspond with it. Herodotus has
sufficient regard for truth to resist this stimulus and to confess
his ignorance; a circumstance which goes, along with others, to
strengthen our confidence in his general authority. His silence
weakens the credibility, but does not refute the allegation
of Pausanias with regard to Miltiadês,—which is certainly not
intrinsically improbable.</p>

<p>I consider this evidence of date to be better than the
statement of Pausanias. That author places the enterprise against
Argos immediately (αὔτικα—Paus. iii, 4, 1) after the accession
of Kleomenês, who, as he was king when Mæandrius came from Samos
(Herodot. iii, 148), must have come to the throne not later than 518
or 517 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> This would be thirty-seven years prior to
480 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small>; a date much too early for the war between
Kleomenês and the Argeians, as we may see by Herodotus (vii, 149).</p>

<p>Plutarch cites the historian Sokratês of Argos for this
story about Telesilla; an historian, or perhaps composer of a
περιήγησις Ἄργους, of unknown date: compare Diogen. Laërt. ii, 5,
47, and Plutarch, Quæstion. Romaic. pp. 270-277. According to his
representation, Kleomenês and Demaratus jointly assaulted the town
of Argos, and Demaratus, after having penetrated into the town and
become master of the Pamphyliakon, was driven out again by the women.
Now Herodotus informs us that Kleomenês and Demaratus were never
employed upon the same expedition, after the disagreement in their
march to Attica (v, 75; vi, 64).</p>

στηθέων δὲ λάμψαντος, πᾶν οἱ πεποιῆσθαι ὅσον ὁ θεὸς ἤθελε.</p>

<p>For the expression αἱρέειν κατ᾽ ἀκρῆς, compare Herodot.
vi, 21, and Damm. Lex. Homer. v. ἀκρός. In this expression, as
generally used, the last words κατ᾽ ἀκρῆς have lost their primitive
and special sense, and do little more than intensify the simple
αἱρέειν,—equivalent to something like “de fond en comble:” for
Kleomenês is accused by his enemies,—φάμενοί μιν δωροδοκήσαντα,
οὐκ ἑλέειν τὸ Ἄργος, παρέον εὐπετέως μιν ἑλεῖν. But in the story
recounted by Kleomenês, the words κατ᾽ ἀκρῆς come back to their
primitive meaning, and serve as the foundation for his religious
inference, from type to thing typified: if the light had shone from
the head or <i>top</i> of the statue, this would have intimated that the
gods meant him to take the city “<i>from top to bottom</i>.”</p>

<p>In regard to this very illustrative story,—which there seems
no reason for mistrusting,—the contrast between the point of view
of Herodotus and that of the Spartan ephors deserves notice. The
former, while he affirms distinctly that it was the real story told
by Kleomenês, suspects its truth, and utters as much of skepticism
as his pious fear will permit him; the latter find it in complete
harmony, both with their canon of belief and with their religious
feeling,—Κλεομένης δέ σφι ἔλεξε, οὔτε εἰ ψευδόμενος οὔτε εἰ ἀληθέα

an analogous case afterwards, where the succession was disputed
between Agesilaus the brother, and Leotychidês the reputed son of

themselves to pronounce Leotychidês illegitimate; or rather to assume
tacitly such illegitimacy by choosing Agesilaus in preference,
without the aid of the oracle (Xenophon, Hellen. iii, 3, 1-4;
Plutarch, Agesilaus, c. 3). The previous oracle from Delphi, however,

<p>See the observations on the battle of Marathon, made both by
Colonel Leake and by Mr. Finlay, who have examined and described the
locality; Leake, on the Demi of Attica, in Transactions of the Royal
Society of Literature, vol. ii, p. 160, <i>seq.</i>; and Finlay, on the
Battle of Marathon, in the same Transactions, vol. iii, pp. 360-380,
etc.</p>

<p>Both have given remarks on the probable numbers of the armies
assembled; but there are really no materials, even for a probable
guess, in respect to the Persians. The silence of Herodotus (whom we
shall find hereafter very circumstantial as to the numbers of the
army under Xerxês) seems to show that he had no information which he
could trust. His account of the battle of Marathon presents him in
honorable contrast with the loose and boastful assertors who followed
him; for though he does not tell us much, and falls lamentably
short of what we should like to know, yet all that he does say is
reasonable and probable as to the proceedings of both armies and
the little which he states becomes more trustworthy on that very
account,—because it <i>is</i> so little,—showing that he keeps strictly
within his authorities.</p>

<p>There is nothing in the account of Herodotus to make us believe
that he had ever visited the ground of Marathon.</p>

<p>Colonel Leake thinks that the ancient town of Marathon was not on
the exact site of the modern Marathon, but at a place called Vraná, a
little to the south of Marathon (Leake, on the Demi of Attica, in the
Transactions of the Royal Society of Literature, 1829, vol. ii, p.
166).</p>

<p>“Below these two points,” he observes, “(the tumuli of Vraná and
the hill of Kotróni,) the plain of Marathon expands to the shore of
the bay, which is near two miles distant from the opening of the
valley of Vraná. It is moderately well cultivated with corn, and is
one of the most fertile spots in Attica, though rather inconveniently
subject to inundations from the two torrents which cross it,
particularly that of Marathóna. From Lucian (in Icaro-Menippo) it
appears that the parts about Œnoê were noted for their fertility,
and an Egyptian poet of the fifth century has celebrated the vines
and olives of Marathon. It is natural to suppose that the vineyards
occupied the rising grounds: and it is probable that the olive-trees
were chiefly situated in the two valleys, where some are still
growing: for as to the plain itself, the circumstances of the battle
incline one to believe that it was anciently as destitute of trees as
it is at the present day.” (Leake, on the Demi of Attica, Trans. of
Roy. Soc. of Literature, vol. ii, p. 162.)</p>

<p>Colonel Leake farther says, respecting the fitness of the
Marathonian ground for cavalry movements: “As I rode across the plain
of Marathon with a peasant of Vraná, he remarked to me that it was
a fine place for cavalry to fight in. None of the modern Marathonii
were above the rank of laborers: they have heard that a great battle
was once fought there, but that is all they know.” (Leake, <i>ut sup.</i>
ii, p. 175.)</p>

<p>We may compare, with this established battle-array of the Persian
armies, that of the Turkish armies, adopted and constantly followed
ever since the victorious battle of Ikonium, in 1386, gained by
Amurath the First over the Karamanians. The European troops, or
those of Rum, occupy the left wing: the Asiatic troops, or those
of Anatoli, the right wing: the Janissaries are in the centre. The
Sultan, or the Grand Vizir, surrounded by the national cavalry, or
Spahis, is in the central point of all (Von Hammer, Geschichte des
Osmannischen Reichs, book v, vol. i, p. 199).</p>

<p>About the honor of occupying the right wing in a Grecian army,
see in particular the animated dispute between the Athenians and
the Tegeates before the battle of Platæa (Herodot. ix, 27): it is
the post assigned to the heroic kings of legendary warfare (Eurip.
Supplices, 657).</p>

<p>The running pace of the charge was obviously one of the most
remarkable events connected with the battle. Colonel Leake and Mr.
Finlay seem disposed to reduce the run to a quick march; partly on
the ground that the troops must have been disordered and out of
breath by running a mile. The probability is, that they really were
so, and that such was the great reason of the defeat of the centre.
It is very probable that a part of the mile run over consisted of
declivity. I accept the account of Herodotus literally, though
whether the distance be exactly stated, we cannot certainly say:
indeed the fact is, that it required some steadiness of discipline
to prevent the step of hoplites, when charging, from becoming
accelerated into a run. See the narrative of the battle of Kunaxa in
Xenoph. Anabas. i, 8, 18; Diodor. xiv, 23: compare Polyæn. ii, 2, 3.
The passage of Diodorus here referred to contrasts the advantages
with the disadvantages of the running charge.</p>

<p>Both Colonel Leake and Mr. Finlay try to point out the exact
ground occupied by the two armies: they differ in the spot chosen,
and I cannot think that there is sufficient evidence to be had in
favor of any spot. Leake thinks that the Persian commanders were
encamped in the plain of Tricorythos, separated from that of Marathon
by the great marsh, and communicating with it only by means of a
causeway (Leake, Transact. ii, p. 170).</p>

<p>Boëdromion was the third month of the Attic year, which year
began near about the summer solstice. The first three Attic months,
Hekatombæon, Metageitnion, Boëdromion, approach (speaking in a loose
manner) nearly to our July, August, September; probably the month
Hekatombæon began usually at some day in the latter half of June.</p>

<p>From the fact that the courier Pheidippidês reached Sparta on the
ninth day of the moon, and that the two thousand Spartans arrived in
Attica on the third day after the full moon, during which interval
the battle took place, we see that the sixth day of Boëdromion
could not be the sixth day of the moon. The Attic months, though
professedly lunar months, did not at this time therefore accurately
correspond with the course of the moon. See Mr. Clinton, Fast.
Hellen. ad an. 490 <small>B.&nbsp;C.</small> Plutarch (in the Treatise De
Malign. Herodoti, above referred to) appears to have no conception of
this discrepancy between the Attic month and the course of the moon.
A portion of the censure which he casts on Herodotus is grounded on
the assumption that the two must coincide.</p>

<p>M. Boeckh, following Fréret and Larcher, contests the statement
of Plutarch, that the battle was fought on the sixth of the month
Boëdromion, but upon reasons which appear to me insufficient. His
chief argument rests upon another statement of Plutarch (derived
from some lost verses of Æschylus), that the tribe Æantis had the
right wing or post of honor at the battle; and that the public vote,
pursuant to which the army was led out of Athens, was passed during
the prytany of the tribe Æantis. He assumes, that the reason why this
tribe was posted on the right wing, must have been, that it had drawn
by lot the first prytany in that particular year: if this be granted,
then the vote for drawing out the army must have been passed in the
first prytany, or within the first thirty-five or thirty-six days of
the Attic year, during the space between the first of Hekatombæon
and the fifth or sixth of Metageitnion. But it is certain that the
interval, which took place between the army leaving the city and
the battle, was much less than one month,—we may even say less than
one week. The battle, therefore, must have been fought between the
sixth and tenth of Metageitnion. (Plutarch, Symposiac. i, 10, 3, and
Ideler, Handbuch der Chronologie, vol. i, p. 291.) Herodotus (vi,
111) says that the tribes were arranged in line ὡς ἠριθμέοντο,—“as
they were numbered,”—which is contended to mean necessarily the
arrangement between them, determined by lot for the prytanies of
that particular year. “In acie instruendâ (says Boeckh, Comment. ad
Corp. Inscript. p. 299) Athenienses non constantem, sed variabilem
secundum prytanias, ordinem secatos esse, ita ut tribus ex hoc ordine
inde a dextro cornu disponerentur, docui in Commentatione de pugnâ
Marathoniâ.” Proœmia Lect. Univ. Berolin. æstiv. a. 1816.</p>

<p>The Proœmia here referred to I have not been able to consult,
and they may therefore contain additional reasons to prove the point
advanced, viz., that the order of the ten tribes in line of battle,
beginning from the right wing, was conformable to their order in
prytanizing, as drawn by lot for the year; but I think the passages
of Herodotus and Plutarch now before us insufficient to establish
this point. From the fact that the tribe Æantis had the right wing
at the battle of Marathon, we are by no means warranted in inferring
that that tribe had drawn by lot the earliest prytany in the year.
Other reasons, in my judgment equally probable, may be assigned in
explanation of the circumstance: one reason, I think, decidedly
<i>more</i> probable. This reason is, that the battle was fought during
the prytany of the tribe Æantis, which may be concluded from the
statement of Plutarch, that the vote for marching out the army from
Athens was passed during the prytany of that tribe; for the interval,
between the march of the army out of the city and the battle, must
have been only a very few days. Moreover, the deme Marathon belonged
to the tribe Æantis (see Boeckh, ad Inscript. No. 172, p. 309): the
battle being fought in their deme, the Marathonians may perhaps have
claimed on this express ground the post of honor for their tribe;
just as we see that at the first battle of Mantineia against the
Lacedæmonians, the Mantineians were allowed to occupy the right wing
or post of honor, “because the battle was fought in their territory,”
(Thucyd. v, 67.) Lastly, the deme Aphidnæ also belonged to the
tribe Æantis (see Boeckh, <i>l.&nbsp;c.</i>): now the polemarch Kallimachus
was an Aphidnæan (Herodot. vi, 109), and Herodotus expressly tells
us, “the law or custom <i>then</i> stood among the Athenians, that the
polemarch should have the right wing,”—ὁ γὰρ νόμος τότε εἶχε οὕτω
τοῖσι Ἀθηναίοισι, τὸν πολέμαρχον ἔχειν κέρας τὸ δέξιον (vi, 111).
Where the polemarch stood, there his tribe would be likely to
stand: and the language of Herodotus indeed seems directly to imply
that he identifies the tribe of the polemarch with the polemarch
himself,—ἡγεομένου δὲ τούτου, ἐξεδέκοντο ὡς ἀριθμέοντο αἱ φυλαὶ,
ἐχόμεναι ἀλλήλων,—meaning that the order of tribes began by that of
the polemarch being in the leading position, and was then “taken up”
by the rest “in numerical sequence,”—<i>i. e.</i> in the order of their
prytanizing sequence for the year.</p>

<p>Here are a concurrence of reasons to explain why the tribe Æantis
had the right wing at the battle of Marathon, even though it may not
have been first in the order of prytanizing tribes for the year.
Boeckh, therefore, is not warranted in inferring the second of these
two facts from the first.</p>

<p>The concurrence of these three reasons, all in favor of the same
conclusion, and all independent of the reason supposed by Boeckh,
appears to me to have great weight; but I regard the first of the
three, even singly taken, as more probable than his reason. If my
view of the case be correct, the sixth day of Boëdromion, the day of
battle as given by Plutarch, is not to be called in question. That
day comes in the second prytany of the year, which begins about the
sixth of Metageitnion, and ends about the twelfth of Boëdromion, and
which must in this year have fallen to the lot of the tribe Æantis.
On the first or second day of Boëdromion, the vote for marching out
the army may have passed; on the sixth the battle was fought; both
during the prytany of this tribe.</p>

<p>I am not prepared to carry these reasons farther than the
particular case of the battle of Marathon, and the vindication of
the day of that battle as stated by Plutarch; nor would I apply
them to later periods, such as the Peloponnesian war. It is certain
that the army regulations of Athens were considerably modified
between the battle of Marathon and the Peloponnesian war, as well
in other matters as in what regards the polemarch; and we have not
sufficient information to enable us to determine whether in that
later period the Athenians followed any known or perpetual rule in
the battle-order of the tribes. Military considerations, connected
with the state of the particular army serving, must have prevented
the constant observance of any rule: thus we can hardly imagine that
Nikias, commanding the army before Syracuse, could have been tied
down to any invariable order of battle among the tribes to which
his hoplites belonged. Moreover, the expedition against Syracuse
lasted more than one Attic year: can it be believed that Nikias,
on receiving information from Athens of the sequence in which the
prytanies of the tribes had been drawn by lot during the second
year of his expedition, would be compelled to marshal his army in a
new battle-order conformably to it? As the military operations of
the Athenians became more extensive, they would find it necessary
to leave such dispositions more and more to the general serving in
every particular campaign. It may well be doubted whether during the
Peloponnesian war <i>any</i> established rule was observed in marshalling
the tribes for battle.</p>

<p>One great motive which induces critics to maintain that the
battle was fought in the Athenian month Metageitnion, is, that that
month coincides with the Spartan month Karneius, so that the refusal
of the Spartans to march before the full moon, is construed to apply
only to the peculiar sanctity of this last-mentioned month, instead
of being a constant rule for the whole year. I perfectly agree with
these critics, that the answer, given by the Spartans to the courier
Pheidippidês, cannot be held to prove a regular, invariable Spartan
maxim, applicable throughout the whole year, not to begin a march in
the second quarter of the moon: very possibly, as Boeckh remarks,
there may have been some festival impending during the particular
month in question, upon which the Spartan refusal to march was
founded. But no inference can be deduced from hence to disprove the
sixth of Boëdromion as the day of the battle of Marathon: for though
the months of every Grecian city were professedly lunar, yet they
never coincided with each other exactly or long together, because the
systems of intercalation adopted in different cities were different:
there was great irregularity and confusion (Plutarch, Aristeidês, c.
19; Aristoxenus, Harmon. ii, p. 30: compare also K. F. Hermann, Ueber
die Griechische Monatskunde, p. 26, 27. Göttingen, 1844; and Boeckh,
ad Corp. Inscript. t. i, p. 734).</p>

<p>Granting, therefore, that the answer given by the Spartans to
Pheidippidês is to be construed, not as a general rule applicable to
the whole year, but as referring to the particular month in which
it was given,—no inference can be drawn from hence as to the day
of the battle of Marathon, because either one of the two following
suppositions is possible: 1. The Spartans may have had solemnities on
the day of the full moon, or on the day before it, in <i>other months</i>
besides Karneius; 2. Or the full moon of the Spartan Karneius may

of the word σταθμὸς is explained by Herodot. v, 52. σταθμὸς ἑωϋτοῦ
is the same as σταθμὸς βασιλήϊος: the particulars which Herodotus
recounts about Arderikka, and its remarkable well, or pit of bitumen,
salt, and oil, give every reason to believe that he had himself
stopped there.</p>

<p>Strabo places the captive Eretrians in Gordyênê, which would be
considerably higher up the Tigris; upon whose authority, we do not
know (Strabo, xv, p. 747).</p>

<p>The many particulars which are given respecting the descendants
of these Eretrians in Kissia, by Philostratus, in his Life of
Apollonius of Tyana, as they are alleged to have stood even in the
first century of the Christian era, cannot be safely quoted. With
all the fiction there contained, some truth may perhaps be mingled;
but we cannot discriminate it (Philostratus, Vit. Apollon. i, c.
24-30).</p>

<p>Plato (Gorgias, c. 153, p. 516) says that the Athenians passed
a vote to cast Miltiadês into the barathrum (ἐμβαλεῖν ἐψηφίσαντο),
and that he would have been actually thrown in, if it had not been
for the prytanis, <i>i. e.</i> the president, by turn for that day, of
the prytanizing senators and of the ekklesia. The prytanis may
perhaps have been among those who spoke to the dikastery on behalf of
Miltiadês, deprecating the proposition made by Xanthippus; but that
he should have caused a vote once passed to be actually rescinded,
is incredible. The Scholiast on Aristeidês (cited by Valckenaer ad
Herodot. vi, 136) reduces the exaggeration of Plato to something
more reasonable—Ὅτε γὰρ ἐκρίνετο Μιλτιάδης ἐπὶ τῇ Πάρῳ, <span

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_677"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_677">[677]</a></span> That this was the habitual
course of Attic procedure in respect to public indictments, wherever
a positive amount of penalty was not previously determined, appears
certain. See Platner, Prozess und Klagen bei den Attikern, Abschn.
vi, vol. i, p. 201; Heffter, Die Athenäische Gerichtsverfassung,
p. 334. Meier and Schömann (Der Attische Prozess, b. iv, p. 725)
maintain that any one of the dikasts might propose a third measure
of penalty, distinct from that proposed by the accuser as well as
the accused. In respect to public indictments, this opinion appears
decidedly incorrect; but where the sentence to be pronounced involved
a compensation for private wrong and an estimate of damages, we
cannot so clearly determine whether there was not sometimes a greater
latitude in originating propositions for the dikasts to vote upon.
It is to be recollected that these dikasts were several hundred,
sometimes even more, in number,—that there was no discussion or
deliberation among them,—and that it was absolutely necessary for
some distinct proposition to be laid before them to take a vote upon.
In regard to some offences, the law expressly permitted what was
called a προστíμημα; that is, after the dikasts had pronounced the
full penalty demanded by the accuser, any other citizen who thought
the penalty so imposed insufficient, might call for a certain limited
amount of additional penalty, and require the dikasts to vote upon
it,—ay or no. The votes of the dikasts were given, by depositing
pebbles in two casks, under certain arrangements of detail.</p>

<p>The ἀγὼν τιμητὸς, δίκη τιμητὸς, or trial including this separate
admeasurement of penalty,—as distinguished from the δίκη ἀτίμητος,
or trial where the penalty was predetermined, and where was no
τίμησις, or vote of admeasurement of penalty,—is an important
line of distinction in the subject-matter of Attic procedure; and
the practice of calling on the accused party, after having been
pronounced guilty, to impose upon himself a <i>counter-penalty</i> or
<i>under-penalty</i> (ἀντιτιμᾶσθαι or ὑποτιμᾶθαι) in contrast with that
named by the accuser, was a convenient expedient for bringing the
question to a substantive vote of the dikasts. Sometimes accused
persons found it convenient to name very large penalties on
themselves, in order to escape a capital sentence invoked by the
accuser (see Dêmosthen. cont. Timokrat. c. 34, p. 743, R). Nor was
there any fear, as Platner imagines, that in the generality of cases
the dikasts would be left under the necessity of choosing between an
extravagant penalty and something merely nominal; for the interest
of the accused party himself would prevent this from happening.
Sometimes we see him endeavoring by entreaties to prevail upon the
accuser voluntarily to abate something of the penalty which he had at
first named; and the accuser might probably do this, if he saw that
the dikasts were not likely to go along with that first proposition.
</p>

<p>In one particular case, of immortal memory, that which Platner
contemplates actually did happen; and the death of Sokratês was
the effect of it. Sokratês, having been found guilty, only by a
small majority of votes among the dikasts, was called upon to name
a penalty upon himself, in opposition to that of death, urged by
Melêtus. He was in vain entreated by his friends to name a fine of
some tolerable amount, which they would at once have paid in his
behalf; but he would hardly be prevailed upon to name any penalty at
all, affirming that he had deserved honor rather than punishment: at
last, he named a fine so small in amount, as to be really tantamount
to an acquittal. Indeed, Xenophon states that he would not name
any counter-penalty at all; and in the speech ascribed to him, he
contended that he had even merited the signal honor of a public
maintenance in the prytaneium (Plato, Apol. Sok. c. 27; Xenoph. Apol.
Sok. 23; Diogen. Laërt. ii, 41). Plato and Xenophon do not agree;
but taking the two together, it would seem that he must have named a
very small fine. There can be little doubt that this circumstance,
together with the tenor of his defence, caused the dikasts to vote
for the proposition of Melêtus.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p id="Footnote_678"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_678">[678]</a></span> Cornelius Nepos, Miltiadês, c.
7; and Kimon, c. 1; Plutarch, Kimon, c. 4; Diodorus, Fragment. lib.
x. All these authors probably drew from the same original fountain;
perhaps Ephorus (see Marx, ad Ephori Fragmenta, p. 212); but we have
no means of determining. Respecting the alleged imprisonment of
Kimon, however, they must have copied from different authorities,
for their statements are all different. Diodorus states, that Kimon
put himself voluntarily into prison after his father had died there,
because he was not permitted on any other condition to obtain the
body of his deceased father for burial. Cornelius Nepos affirms that
he was imprisoned, as being legally liable to the state for the
unpaid fine of his father. Lastly, Plutarch does not represent him as
having been put into prison at all. Many of the Latin writers follow
the statement of Diodorus: see the citations in Bos’s note on the
above passage of Cornelius Nepos.</p>

<p>There can be no hesitation in adopting the account of Plutarch
as the true one. Kimon neither was, nor could be, in prison, by the
Attic law, for an unpaid fine of his father; but after his father’s
death, he became liable for the fine, in this sense,—that he remained
disfranchised (ἄτιμος) and excluded from his rights as a citizen,
until the fine was paid: see Dêmosthen. cont. Timokrat. c. 46, p.
762, R.</p>

takes a different view of this point, with which I cannot concur
(Hist. Gr. vol. iii, Append. ii, p. 488); though his general remarks
on the trial of Miltiadês are just and appropriate (ch. xiv, p. 273).
</p>

<p>Cornelius Nepos (Miltiadês, c. 8; Kimon, c. 3) says that the
misconduct connected with Paros was only a pretence with the
Athenians for punishing Miltiadês; their real motive, he affirms,
was envy and fear, the same feelings which dictated the ostracism of
Kimon. How little there is to justify this fancy, may be seen even
from the nature of the punishment inflicted. Fear would have prompted
them to send away or put to death Miltiadês, not to fine him. The
ostracism, which was dictated by fear, was a temporary banishment.</p>

so much as <i>this</i>, in the clear and forcible statement which he
gives of the question here alluded to: he contends that the man who
has rendered services ought to be recompensed for them, but that he
ought to be punished for subsequent crime just as if the previous
services had not been rendered. He lays down this position in
discussing the conduct of the Romans towards the victorious survivor
of the three Horatii, after the battle with the Curiatii: “Erano
stati i meriti di Orazio grandissimi, avendo con la sua virtù vinti
i Curiazi. Era stato il fallo suo atroce, avendo morto la sorella.
Nondimeno dispiacque tanto tale omicidio ai Romani, che lo condussero
a disputare della vita, non ostante che gli meriti suoi fussero
tanto grandi e si freschi. La qual cosa, a chi superficialmente
la considerasse, parrebbe uno esempio d’ ingratitudine popolare.
Nondimeno chi lo esaminerà meglio, e con migliore considerazione
ricercherà quali debbono essere gli’ ordini delle republiche,
biasimearà quel popolo piuttosto per averlo assoluto, che per averlo
voluto condannare: e la ragione è questa, che nessuna republica
bene ordinata, non mai cancellò i demeriti con gli meriti dei suoi
cittadini: ma avendo ordinati i premi ad una buona opera, e le pene
ad una cattiva, ed avendo premiato uno per aver bene operato, se quel
medesimo opera dipoi male, lo gastiga senza avere riguardo alcuno
alle sue buone opere. E quando questi ordini sono bene osservati, una
città vive libera molto tempo: altrimenti sempre rovinera presto.
<i>Perchè se, ad un cittadino che abbia fatto qualche egregia opere
per la città, si aggiunge oltre alla riputazione, che quella cosa
gli arreca, una audacia e confidenza di potere senza temer pena, far
qualche opera non buona, diventerà in breve tempo tanto insolente,
che si risolverà ogni civiltà.</i>”—Machiavel, Discorsi sop. Tit. Livio,

Compare chapter fifty-nine of the same work, where he again supports
a similar opinion.</p>

<p>M. Sismondi also observes, in speaking of the long attachment of
the city of Pisa to the cause of the emperors and to the Ghibelin
party: “Pise montra dans plus d’une occasion, par sa constance à

reconnoissance lie un peuple libre d’une manière plus puissante et

which ancient authors often state, both partially, and in exaggerated
terms as to degree: “Hæc est natura multitudinis (says Livy); aut
humiliter servit aut superbe dominatur.” Again, Tacitus: “Nihil
in vulgo modicum; terrere, ni paveant; ubi pertimuerint, impune
contemni.” (Annal. i, 29.) Herodotus, iii, 81. ὠθέει δὲ (ὁ δῆμος)

<p>It is remarkable that Aristotle, in his Politica, takes little
or no notice of this attribute belonging to every numerous assembly.
He seems rather to reason as if the aggregate intelligence of the
multitude was represented by the sum total of each man’s separate
intelligence in all the individuals composing it (Polit. iii, 6, 4,
10, 12); just as the property of the multitude, taken collectively,
would be greater than that of the few rich. He takes no notice of
the difference between a number of individuals judging jointly and
judging separately: I do not, indeed, observe that such omission
leads him into any positive mistake, but it occurs in some cases
calculated to surprise us, and where the difference here adverted to
is important to notice: see Politic. iii, 10, 5, 6.</p>

of Himera from granting a guard to Phalaris: Conon (Narrat. 42 ap.

ἄπειρον to an elaborate discussion, in which he says very little
more about Anaximander, who appears to have assumed it without
anticipating discussion or objections. Whether Anaximander called his

<p>Dr. Thirlwall conceives Xenophanês as having intended in the
passage above cited to treat the doctrine of the metempsychosis “with
deserved ridicule.” (Hist. of Greece, ch. xii, vol. ii, p. 162.)
Religious opinions are so apt to appear ridiculous to those who do
not believe them, that such a suspicion is not unnatural; yet I
think, if Xenophanês had been so disposed, he would have found more
ridiculous examples among the many which this doctrine might suggest.
Indeed, it seems hardly possible to present the metempsychosis in a
more touching or respectable point of view than that which the lines
of his poem set forth. The particular animal selected is that one
between whom and man the sympathy is most marked and reciprocal,
while the doctrine is made to enforce a practical lesson against
cruelty.</p>

volume of his edition of Hippokratês (p. 662).</p>

<p>After having observed (p. 659) that physiology may be considered
as divided into two parts,—one relating to the mechanism of the
functions; the other, to the effects produced upon the human body by
the different influences which act upon it and the media by which
it is surrounded; and after having observed that on the first of
these two branches the ancients could never make progress from their
ignorance of anatomy,—he goes on to state, that respecting the second
branch they acquired a large amount of knowledge:—</p>

<p>“Sur la physiologie des influences extérieures, la Grèce du temps
d’Hippocrate et après lui fut le théâtre d’expériences en grand,
les plus importantes et les plus instructives. Toute la population
(la population libre, s’entend) étoit soumise à un système régulier
d’éducation physique (N. B. this is a little too strongly stated):
dans quelques cités, à Lacédémone par exemple, les femmes n’en
étoient pas exemptées. Ce système se composoit d’exercices et d’une
alimentation, que combinèrent l’empirisme d’abord, puis une théorie
plus savante: il concernoit (comme dit Hippocrate lui-même, en ne
parlant, il est vrai, que de la partie alimentaire), il concernoit et
les malades pour leur rétablissement, et les gens bien portans pour
la conservation de leur santé, et les personnes livrées aux exercices
gymnastiques pour l’accroissement de leurs forces. On savoit au juste
ce qu’il falloit pour conserver seulement le corps en bon état ou
pour traiter un malade—pour former un militaire ou pour faire un
athlète—et en particulier, un lutteur, un coureur, un sauteur, un
pugiliste. Une classe d’hommes, les maîtres des gymnases, étoient
exclusivement adonnés à la culture de cet art, auquel les médecins
participoient dans les limites de leur profession, et Hippocrate,
qui dans les Aphorismes, invoque l’exemple des athlètes, nous
parle dans le Traité des Articulations des personnes maigres, qui
n’ayant pas été amaigris par un procédé régulier de l’art, ont les
chairs muqueuses. Les anciens médecins savoient, comme on le voit,
procurer l’amaigrissement conformément à l’art, et reconnoitre à ses
effets un amaigrissement irrégulier: toutes choses auxquelles nos
médecins sont étrangers, et dont on ne retrouve l’analogue que parmi
les <i>entraineurs</i> Anglois. Au reste cet ensemble de connoissances
empiriques et théoriques doit être mis au rang des pertes fâcheuses
qui ont accompagné la longue et turbulente transition du monde
ancien an monde moderne. Les admirables institutions destinées dans
l’antiquité à développer et affermir le corps, ont disparu: l’hygiène
publique est déstituée à cet égard de toute direction scientifique et
générale, et demeure abandonnée complètement au hasard.”</p>

<p id="Footnote_732"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_732">[732]</a></span> The compilations of Porphyry
and Jamblichus on the life of Pythagoras, copied from a great variety
of authors, will doubtless contain some truth amidst their confused
heap of statements, many incredible, and nearly all unauthenticated.
But it is very difficult to single out what these portions of truth
really are. Even Aristoxenus and Dikæarchus, the best authors
from whom these biographers quote, lived near two centuries after
the death of Pythagoras, and do not appear to have had any early
memorials to consult, nor any better informants than the contemporary
Pythagoreans,—the last of an expiring sect, and probably among the
least eminent for intellect, since the philosophers of the Sokratic
school in its various branches carried off the acute and aspiring
young men of that time.</p>

<p>Meiners, in his Geschichte der Wissenschaften (vol. i, b. iii,
p. 191, <i>seq.</i>), has given a careful analysis of the various authors
from whom the two biographers have borrowed, and a comparative
estimate of their trustworthiness. It is an excellent piece of
historical criticism, though the author exaggerates both the merits
and the influence of the first Pythagoreans: Kiessling, in the
notes to his edition of Jamblichus, has given some extracts from
it, but by no means enough to dispense with the perusal of the
original. I think Meiners allows too much credit, on the whole, to
Aristoxenus (see p. 214), and makes too little deduction for the
various stories, difficult to be believed, of which Aristoxenus is
given as the source: of course the latter could not furnish better
matter than he heard from his own witnesses. Where Meiners’s judgment
is more severe, it is also better borne out, especially respecting
Porphyry himself, and his scholar Jamblichus. These later Pythagorean
philosophers seem to have set up as a formal canon of credibility,
that which many religious men of antiquity acted upon from a mere
unconscious sentiment and fear of giving offence to the gods,—That
it was <i>not right to disbelieve any story</i> recounted respecting the
gods, and wherein the divine agency was introduced: no one could tell
but what it <i>might be true</i>: to deny its truth, was to set bounds
to the divine omnipotence. Accordingly, they made no difficulty
in believing what was recounted about Aristæus, Abaris, and other
eminent subjects of mythes (Jamblichus, Vit. Pyth. c. 138-148)—καὶ
τοῦτό γε πάντες οἱ Πυθαγόρειοι ὅμως ἔχουσι πιστευτικῶς, οἶον περὶ
Ἀρισταίου καὶ Ἀβάριδος τὰ μυθολογούμενα καὶ ὅσα ἄλλα τοιαῦτα
λέγεται ... τῶν τοιούτων δὲ τῶν δοκούντων μυθικῶν ἀπομνημονεύουσιν,
<span class="gesperrt">ὡς οὐδὲν ἀπιστοῦντες ὅτι ἂν εἰς τὸ θεῖον
ἀναγηται</span>. Also, not less formally laid down in Jamblichus,
Adhortatio ad Philosophiam, as the fourth Symbolum, p. 324, ed.
Kiessling. Περὶ θεῶν μηδὲν θαυμαστὸν ἀπιστεῖ, μηδὲ περὶ θείων
δογμάτων. Reasoning from their principles, this was a consistent
corollary to lay down; but it helps us to estimate their value as
selectors and discriminators of accounts respecting Pythagoras. The
extravagant compliments paid by the emperor Julian in his letters to
Jamblichus will not suffice to establish the authority of the latter

<p id="Footnote_737"><span class="label"><a
href="#FNanchor_737">[737]</a></span> I transcribe here the summary
given by Krische, at the close of his Dissertation on the Pythagorean
order, p. 101: “Societatis scopus fuit mere politicus, ut lapsam
optimatium potestatem non modo in pristinum restitueret, sed firmaret
amplificaretque: cum summo hoc scopo duo conjuncti fuerunt; moralis
alter, alter ad literas spectans. Discipulos suos bonos probosque
homines reddere voluit Pythagoras, et ut civitatem moderantes
potestate suâ non abuterentur ad plebem opprimendam; et ut plebs,
intelligens suis commodis consuli, conditione suâ contenta esset.
Quoniam vero bonum sapiensque moderamen nisi a prudente literisque
exculto viro exspectari (non) licet, philosophiæ studium necessarium
duxit Samius iis, qui ad civitatis clavum tenendum se accingerent.”
</p>

<p>This is the general view (coinciding substantially with that
of O. Müller,—Dorians, iii, 9, 16) given by an author who has gone
through the evidences with care and learning. It differs on some
important points from the idea which I conceive of the primitive
master and his contemporary brethren. It leaves out the religious
ascendency, which I imagine to have stood first among the means as
well as among the premeditated purposes of Pythagoras, and sets forth
a reformatory political scheme as directly contemplated by him, of
which there is no proof. Though the political ascendency of the early
Pythagoreans is the most prominent feature in their early history,
it is not to be considered as the manifestation of any peculiar or
settled political idea,—it is rather a result of their position and
means of union. Ritter observes, in my opinion more justly: “We must
not believe that the mysteries of the Pythagorean order were of a
simply political character: the most probable accounts warrant us in
considering that its central point was a mystic religious teaching,”
(Geschicht. der Philosophie, b. iv, ch. i, vol. i, pp. 365-368:)
compare Hoeck. Kreta, vol. iii, p. 223.</p>

<p>Krische (p. 32) as well as Boeckh (Philolaus, pp. 39-42) and
O. Müller assimilate the Pythagorean life to the Dorian or Spartan
habits, and call the Pythagorean philosophy the expression of
Grecian Dorism, as opposed to the Ionians and the Ionic philosophy.
I confess that I perceive no analogy between the two, either in
action or speculation. The Spartans stand completely distinct from
other Dorians; and even the Spartan habits of life, though they
present some points of resemblance with the bodily training of the
Pythagoreans, exhibit still more important points of difference,
in respect to religious peculiarity and mysticism, as well as to
scientific element embodied with it. The Pythagorean philosophy,
and the Eleatic philosophy, were both equally opposed to the Ionic;
yet neither of them is in any way connected with Dorian tendencies.
Neither Elea nor Kroton were Doric cities; moreover, Xenophanês as
well as Pythagoras were both Ionians.</p>

<p>The general assertions respecting Ionic mobility and inconstancy,
contrasted with Doric constancy and steadiness, will not be found
borne out by a study of facts. The Dorism of Pythagoras appears to
me a complete fancy. O. Müller even turns Kroton into a Dorian city,
contrary to all evidence.</p>

is Apollonius of Tyana, has been rendered probable by Meiners (Gesch.

<p>When we read the life of Apollonius by Philostratus, we see that
the former was himself extremely communicative: he might be the

Pythagoras was a defect, and to ascribe to it much of the mischief
which afterwards overtook the order.</p>

That the enemies of the order attacked it by setting fire to the
house in which the members were assembled, is the circumstance
in which all accounts agree. On all other points there is great
discrepancy, especially respecting the names and dates of the
Pythagoreans who escaped: Boeckh (Philolaus, p. 9, <i>seq.</i>) and
Brandis (Handbuch der Gesch. Philos. ch. lxxiii, p. 432) try to
reconcile these discrepancies.</p>

<p>Aristophanês introduces Strepsiadês, at the close of the Nubes,

<p>O. Müller says (Dorians, iii, 9, 16), that “the influence of the
Pythagorean league upon the administration of the Italian states was
of the most beneficial kind, which continued for many generations
after the dissolution of the league itself.”</p>

<p>The first of these two assertions cannot be made out, and depends
only on the statements of later encomiasts, who even supply materials
to contradict their own general view. The judgment of Welcker
respecting the influence of the Pythagoreans, much less favorable, is
at the same time more probable. (Præfat. ad Theognid. p. xlv.)</p>

<p>The second of the two assertions appears to me quite incorrect;
the influence of the Pythagorean order on the government of Magna
Græcia ceased altogether, as far as we are able to judge. An
individual Pythagorean like Archytas might obtain influence, but this
is not the influence of the order. Nor ought O. Müller to talk about
the Italian Greeks giving up the Doric customs and adopting an Achæan
government. There is nothing to prove that Kroton ever had Doric
customs.</p>

change in the channel of the river that I refer the expression in
Herodotus,—τέμενός τε καὶ νηὸν ἐόντα <span class="gesperrt">παρὰ τὸν
ξηρὸν</span> Κρᾶθιν. It was natural that the old deserted bed of the
river should be called “<i>the dry Krathis</i>:” whereas, if we suppose
that there was only one channel, the expression has no appropriate
meaning. For I do not think that any one can be well satisfied with
the explanation of Bähr “Vocatur Crathis hoc loco ξηρὸς <i>siccus</i>, ut
qui hieme fluit, æstatis vero tempore exsiccatus est: quod adhuc in
multis Italiæ inferioris fluviis observant.” I doubt whether this
be true, as a matter of fact, respecting the river Krathis (see my
preceding volume, ch. xxii), but even if the fact were true, the
epithet in Bähr’s sense has no especial significance for the purpose
contemplated by Herodotus, who merely wishes to describe the site
of the temple erected by Dorieus. “Near the Krathis,” or “near the
dry Krathis,” would be equivalent expressions, if we adopted Bähr’s
construction; whereas to say, “near the deserted channel of the
Krathis,” would be a good local designation.</p>

there seems great difficulty in imagining that the state of violent
